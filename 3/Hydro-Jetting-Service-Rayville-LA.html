This will help get rid of any sediment that has actually settled inside the tank.</p>

While tankless water heaters are great in lots of aspects, they are not ideal for everybody. For example, families with a great deal of relative or roommates, as well as those that need more than typical amounts of warm water daily, will probably benefit more from a traditional tank water heater.</p>
