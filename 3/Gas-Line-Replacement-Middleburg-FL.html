<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more.
