<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Centerville IA</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has excellent seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>To make it easy, homeowners with testable backflow gadgets are expected to have them tested by a certified tester every year.
