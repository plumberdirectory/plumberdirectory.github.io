<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>

<p>We all experience a clogged drain at some point. You can attempt to take matters into your hands by using everyday products, such as a plunger, a coat hanger, or a snake. Some homeowners will attempt to dislodge the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural natural home remedy, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These solutions do work, especially if you are handling a little drain clog. However, they are generally temporary fixes that do not offer irreversible resolutions.</p>
