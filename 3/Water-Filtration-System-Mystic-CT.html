<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>

<p>Keep in mind: Hard water stops your washing detergent from working successfully due to the fact that hard water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to use more and more detergent to achieve the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Hard minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and disinfected during regeneration. Lastly, water including the difficult minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
