<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic person. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as guaranteed. I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay may be greater.</p>
<p>Your costs also will include your plumber's charge for eliminating your old disposal and linking the new one. The majority of plumbers charge by the hour, so any problems that crop up will increase the cost. Any damage to you old disposal or connection site may impact the time it takes. These types of heaters can lead to a considerable amount of contamination since carbon monoxide gets launched into the air while burning gas.</p>
