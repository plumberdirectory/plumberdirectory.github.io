I will certainly use Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their property line. Easements (typically 10 feet broad) where main sewers traverse personal property are an exception to this guideline.</p>

We make every effort to satisfy our clients, and our efforts to keep the process environmentally friendly and painless is a crucial element of our work.</p>
