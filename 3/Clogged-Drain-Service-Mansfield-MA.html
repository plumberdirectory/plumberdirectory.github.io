<p>The most effective method to attend to tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Gas fitters are extremely recommended because of the potential threats when working with gas lines, and it's numerous complex details.
