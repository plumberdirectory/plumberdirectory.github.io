<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Coolidge AZ</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves ought to prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand run valve ought to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
