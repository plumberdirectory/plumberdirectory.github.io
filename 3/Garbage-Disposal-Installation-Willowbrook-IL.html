<h3>Tankless Water Heater Repair in Willowbrook Illinois</h2>
<p>House owners frequently ask if a gas hot water heater or an electrical system is more cost-efficient. The response depends on your house. While gas models are more economical to run, they do need an existing natural gas line. The price tag of an electrical water heater is usually lower, but it can be more expensive to operate. Electric varieties are also much easier to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less most likely to lose heat.</p>
<p>Whether a water supply is labelled "soft" or "tough" is dependent on the existence of two extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health standpoint, these minerals have no negative effects and are, in reality, important day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that give water the revitalizing taste lots of people discover preferable. However, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they accumulation on contact surfaces, potentially plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and reduce the effectiveness of cleaning agents and soaps. At this moment the water is stated to be tough.</p>
