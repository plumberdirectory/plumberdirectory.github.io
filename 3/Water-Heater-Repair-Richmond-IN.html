<p>Martens Plumbing & Heating provides a variety of sewer and drain piping repair and replacement services. A clogged sewer line can lead to a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can trigger considerable problems and damage-- particularly common in older houses. Using a sewer camera to inspect the weak locations or clog, our highly trained professionals can rapidly locate the source of the issue keeping your sewer line from doing its job-- effectively transporting wastewater to your sewage-disposal tank or community system.</p>
<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a feasible solution, particularly when simple plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous drawbacks to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your house and household.</p>
