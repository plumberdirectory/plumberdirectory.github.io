<p>If your assembly fails the yearly test, you are responsible for replacing the assembly or fixing within thirty days. All replacements must be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the correct type of assembly based upon the conditions on your home (see area below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Additionally, the assembly should fulfill the lead free requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 30 days, all water services will be ceased up until the assembly remains in compliance.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
