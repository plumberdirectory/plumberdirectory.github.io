<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer computes the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth automatically begins. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regeneration typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit features two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
