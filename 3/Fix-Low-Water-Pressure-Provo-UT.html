It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
