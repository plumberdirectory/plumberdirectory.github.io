<p>While pipe lining is an excellent alternative for most people, there are some situations where repiping is the only choice. Repiping is the process of replacing old rusty pipes with long-lasting and resilient new pipes.

Repiping is mostly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and constructed out of galvanized metals.</p>
