<p>Sewer lines have one important function: carry wastewater out of a home or structure. Most folks replace their water heaters due to bad efficiency, complete failure or as a preventive step. It's time to think about replacing it with a more effective design if your water heater is more than 10 years old. Water on the floor can imply worn parts. Your plumber may replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole.

By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to offer some type of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're working on installing it.
