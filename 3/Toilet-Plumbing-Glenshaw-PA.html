<h3>Faucet Repair in Glenshaw Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the public supply of water and private on-site water system and distribution systems by prohibiting cross-connections between safe and clean (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of main and secondary backflow prevention techniques.

<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
