This results in micro-fractures and lowers the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects.

<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
