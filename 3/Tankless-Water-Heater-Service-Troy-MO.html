Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
