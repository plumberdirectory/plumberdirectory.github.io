<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>

To loosen up the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
<p>A drain professional will need to access the drain line from the roof vents or pull out a toilet. This is normally more labor-intensive and might require additional costs.
