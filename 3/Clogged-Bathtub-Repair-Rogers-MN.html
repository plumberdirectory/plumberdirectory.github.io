<p>Aside from these 2 important parts, there are a myriad of little, maybe less crucial things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
