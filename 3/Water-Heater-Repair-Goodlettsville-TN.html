You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you observe your water has an unusual flow, color, taste or smell. A plumbing professional can determine whether the issue with your faucet is a fast fix or the result of other concerns in your house's plumbing system. More complex issues with water temperature level or pressure might need changing the water heater, which usually costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capability and type.</p>
<p>One of our many professional services at Ryan's Plumbing is toilet repair. A clog or leak in a toilet can cause water damage to your home if not repaired rapidly.
