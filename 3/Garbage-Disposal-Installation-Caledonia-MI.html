<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 Caledonia MI</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP).

Exemptions, which are approved in very rare cases where the structure is deemed to not present a risk to the water supply, need to be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
