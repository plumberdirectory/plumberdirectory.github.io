<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>Natural gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running appliances such as water heaters. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that takes place in the earth's crust and is also often formed by the decomposing of raw materials like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. However, to prevent off that hazard, mercaptans are included into natural gas, which offers it a rotten egg smell and makes it noticeable when leaking. Make certain to only rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
