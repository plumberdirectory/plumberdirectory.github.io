Like any house device, a toilet tank includes lots of small moving parts that may need changed with use gradually. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear out and cause toilet leakages that aren't plainly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can likewise occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>

Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural integrity of the house.</p>
