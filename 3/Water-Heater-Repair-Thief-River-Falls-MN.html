<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
