<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and expensive plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping.

This sediment ultimately gets hard and eliminates from the capability of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
