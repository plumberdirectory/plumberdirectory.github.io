<p>As a locally-owned service, integrity and responsibility are incredibly essential to building a track record for quality. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the potable supply of water within a structure these gadgets are referred to as seclusion" BFP.
