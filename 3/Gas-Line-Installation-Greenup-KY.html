<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over a period of time the within lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a small pinhole leak will develop. Often the solution is to repair the broken section of pipe, and an area repair is all that is needed to solve the issue. Other times a more extensive service is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are needed to carry out website inspections to identify if a backflow prevention device is needed as a result of a prospective or actual cross-connection hazard on a customer's plumbing system. Plumbing and gas piping inspections found on Vashon Island are only carried out on Wednesdays. Area Repairs: Utilizing one or a mix of the above services, we will fix the problems we discover with the camera inspection directly without uprooting anymore than we need to.</p>
