<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
