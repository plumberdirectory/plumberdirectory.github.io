<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
