<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Many homeowners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their dirty or clogged drain problems. These chemicals are easy to use and economical, however they harm your pipes and their impacts are only short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize harsh chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with repeated use, these chemicals will likewise eat away at the pipe creating weak points that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is constantly suggested.</p>
