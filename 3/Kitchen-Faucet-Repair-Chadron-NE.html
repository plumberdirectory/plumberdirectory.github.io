<p>Property owners often ask if a gas hot water heater or an electric unit is more affordable. The response depends upon your house. While gas designs are more economical to run, they do need an existing natural gas line. The cost of an electrical hot water heater is generally lower, however it can be more expensive to run. Electric ranges are also much easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>
<p>Unexpected modifications in water pressure might possibly be due to corrosion and buildup within the pipes themselves, which narrow the passage that water can move through. You'll probably notification lower water pressure in the shower or when washing dishes. The best solution is to replace your plumbing with new pipes that do not have buildup.</p>

After all, too much pressure can damage your plumbing, and insufficient can leave your home with dysfunctional water devices.</p>
