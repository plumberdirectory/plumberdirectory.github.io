Over a period of time the inside lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a small pinhole leak will establish.

<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair specialist understands the proper installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

Lowered pressure in the pipe might enable infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
