<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>

<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Bridgeport TX</h3>
<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually often been misunderstood as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due largely to overstated marketing and, in part, to consumer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening simply gets rid of hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a nuisance and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not requirement. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
