While water overuse is a concern for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can consume to 25 gallons of water every day for their regeneration procedure. That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will lose more water and salt because they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, usually regrow after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are practical if you have a changing water utilize schedule.</p>
