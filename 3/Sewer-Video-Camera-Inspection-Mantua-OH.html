<p>Backpressure is developed when pressure in a water supply goes beyond the pressure in the drinkable system offering the cosmetics water. This can require the potable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Prospective pollutants can then go into the safe and clean water system.

Like any house appliance, a toilet tank features lots of small moving parts that may need replaced with usage in time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear out and cause toilet leakages that aren't clearly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leakages around the base can also occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are installed in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
