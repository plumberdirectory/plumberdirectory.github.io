For example, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any prospective or actual connection between the general public water system and a source of contamination or contamination) can permit toxins or pollutants to go into the drinkable water supply. Illness can result from consuming water that has been infected due to backflow.</p>

When tree roots begin to make their method inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems. The type of drain pipes currently set up, such as cast iron, copper, clay or plastic, will determine the level of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
