<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Lake Saint Louis MO</h3>
<p>These people were incredible! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had fantastic reviews and a fair rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it also.</p>
