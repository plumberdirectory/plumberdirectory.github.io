<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately starts. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regrowth generally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
