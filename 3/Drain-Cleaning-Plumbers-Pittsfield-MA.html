<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.

If your toilet is reasonably brand-new, you might need to switch toilet tissue or employ a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain.
