<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for many construction contractors (or their staff members). The secret to the innovation is being able to control both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thereby removing solidity ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer. This innovation is more cost effective and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer may be needed on the water service line, within the structure, or in both areas. The backflow preventer you select need to be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently listed must have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
<p>Tank to Tank installation: Usually, replacing a gas or electrical water tank with a comparable model takes 2 to 3 hours. It takes in between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, disconnect and eliminate your old hot water heater. Placing the brand-new unit takes roughly thirty minutes, and it takes another 45 to 60 minutes to protect the brand-new connection points and verify that all functions are up to code.</p>
