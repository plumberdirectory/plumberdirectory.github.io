<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Dripping Springs TX</h3>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
