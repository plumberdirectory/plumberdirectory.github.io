<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is typically made from aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can bring in the irons that would usually cause rust. After extended usage, these rods will eventually end up being broken and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you could experience major problems with your hot water heater extremely quickly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>There's a good chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This corrosion can cause an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of negative results on your health. Corroded pipes likewise cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Low pH likewise increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the measure of hydrogen ion activity in an option and is used to express the strength of the acidity of a service. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up rust Co2 will possibly add to the formation of carbonic acid, thereby making the water more corrosive. The presence of high levels of co2 tends to associate with particular geologic conditions.</p>
