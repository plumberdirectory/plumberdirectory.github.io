<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and complex plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. It was a difficult task because of the age of your house and location of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
