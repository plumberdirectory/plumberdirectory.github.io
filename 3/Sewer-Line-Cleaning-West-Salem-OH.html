<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective functioning a requirement more than a need. When the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on really gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to guarantee no valves were mistakenly exposed or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>

A clogged sewer pipe could leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning scam.</p>
