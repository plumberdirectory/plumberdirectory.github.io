<p>Note: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working efficiently due to the fact that hard water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them. You, for that reason, need to utilize increasingly more cleaning agent to attain the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Difficult minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned up and sanitized throughout regrowth.
