If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide could limit the movement (instead of consistent or direct) of the part, which might trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
