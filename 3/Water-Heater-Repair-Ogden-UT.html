<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is likewise a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to find.</p>
