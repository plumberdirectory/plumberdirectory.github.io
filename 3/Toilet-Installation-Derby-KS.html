<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>A waste disposal unit should not leak. It generally suggests wear and tear which is a fair indication that its time is up when this occurs.

The kitchen sink drain may need a basic tightening or a replacement. If the leak remains in the pressurized hose spray, you will see the obvious spray. For a leak in the drain pipe, you might have to fill the sink with water before examining the pipe underneath.</p>
