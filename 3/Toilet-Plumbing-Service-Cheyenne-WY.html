<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a viable option, especially when simple plunging does not seem to work. However, there are many downsides to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they generally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your home and household.</p>
