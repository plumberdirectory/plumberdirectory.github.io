<h3>Clogged Garbage Disposal in Billerica Massachusetts</h2>
<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan, a guideline of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a new burner set and the water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>

<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Billerica MA</h3>
<p>The Plumbers Connection can unclog your storm drain systems with the use of a hydrojetting machine. The hydrojet has a spinning head on the head that releases an extremely high pressure stream of water. The rapidly swirling water is able to jet" through the hardest of obstructions including mud, leaves, branches, garbage and more. Completion outcome is a storm drain system that is free and clean of particles and all set for service.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as difficult water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
