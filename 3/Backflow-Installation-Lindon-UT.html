<p>Clark's Process: This procedure is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which causes the solidity ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 should be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back. When it pertains to pipe repair, the most expensive factors aren't the equipment or materials used, but the landscaping, yard and uprooting damage that occurs.</p>
