<p>A second part of the Battelle Study compared detergent dose, water firmness, and washing temperature to see if solidity had an influence on cleaning agent savings. The study consisted of tests that got rid of challenging soils, in addition to assessing shooting and spotting.

When comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level, that cleaning agent savings rises to nearly 70%.</p>
