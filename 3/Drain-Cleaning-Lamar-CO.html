<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
