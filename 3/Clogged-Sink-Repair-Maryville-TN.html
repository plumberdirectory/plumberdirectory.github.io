<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements.

Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
