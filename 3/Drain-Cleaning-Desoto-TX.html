Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
