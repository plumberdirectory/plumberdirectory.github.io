<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

I was very delighted with their service.</p>
