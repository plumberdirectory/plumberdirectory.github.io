<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. Due to the fact that they restore whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, typically regenerate after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a fluctuating water utilize schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
