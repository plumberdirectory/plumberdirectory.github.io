<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each component. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide might limit the movement (instead of direct or consistent) of the part, which could cause the part to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
