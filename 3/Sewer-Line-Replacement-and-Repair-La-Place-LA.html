<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services La Place LA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your building requires a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in extremely rare cases where the structure is considered to not posture a risk to the water system, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
