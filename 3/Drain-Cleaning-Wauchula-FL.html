<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Some makers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces.
