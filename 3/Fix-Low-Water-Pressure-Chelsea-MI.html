<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you very first try utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the proper safety measures if using one of these items.</p>
