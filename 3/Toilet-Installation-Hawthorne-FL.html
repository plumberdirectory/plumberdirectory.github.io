Although these programs are not a requirement for plumbing contractors, they can offer the advanced knowledge and skills required for those who want to end up being effective business owners and small business owners.</p>
<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair service technician knows the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
