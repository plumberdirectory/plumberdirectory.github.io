<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a practical solution, particularly when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many downsides to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they typically include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, however at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>
