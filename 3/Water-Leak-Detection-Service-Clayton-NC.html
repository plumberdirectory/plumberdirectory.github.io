<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a viable service, particularly when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of disadvantages to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they usually consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your house and family.</p>
