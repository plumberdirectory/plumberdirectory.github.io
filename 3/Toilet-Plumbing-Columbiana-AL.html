Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
