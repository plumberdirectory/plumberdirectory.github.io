Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>This is an elbow-shaped device bent at a 90 degree angle. There is a valve on the within it that prevents water backflow.
