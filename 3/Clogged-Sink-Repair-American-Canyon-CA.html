<p>These people were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had great evaluations and a fair cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it too.</p>
