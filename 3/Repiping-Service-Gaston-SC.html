<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
