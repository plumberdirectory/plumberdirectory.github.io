It is necessary that the repair professional understands the appropriate installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation.
