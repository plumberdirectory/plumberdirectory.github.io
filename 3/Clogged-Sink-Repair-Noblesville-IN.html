<h3>Basic Plumber Tools For Any Job Noblesville IN</h3>
<p>Another typical argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
