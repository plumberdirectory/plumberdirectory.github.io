When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it difficult for the water to pass through. Because of the tight space, the pipes often make odd gurgling sounds as water efforts to travel through a clogged pipe. This causes the water to bubble, as only small pockets of air are accessible, resulting in the unusual sounds originating from your sink.</p>
