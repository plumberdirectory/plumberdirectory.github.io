<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair service technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>Consider all the locations water flows in and out of your home. These are the locations that a professional assessment should cover.
