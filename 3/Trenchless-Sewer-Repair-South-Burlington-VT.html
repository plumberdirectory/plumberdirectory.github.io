The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis.

Depending upon the existing trap setup, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>

For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger pipes to lose pressure. When that takes place, water is no longer pushed forward into the residential or commercial property, enabling it to flow backwards into city water materials.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to avoid backflow. The standard ways of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either eliminates a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The fundamental mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.</p>
