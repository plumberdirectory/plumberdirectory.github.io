The typical cost to reroute a gas or move line is in between $15 and $25 per direct foot. Contributing factors to the last rate consist of the piping, range, and conditions.

Lastly, a quality contractor will not threat working with a substandard plumber. A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and make complex the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and claims. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the best.</p>
