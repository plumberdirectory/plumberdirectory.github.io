<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or buying an older home.</p>
<p>Do not put whatever down your garbage disposal. It's important to watch what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and potentially trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can likewise trigger blockages and jams - think about composting or placing these products in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can congeal and collect in your drain as well. After ending up cooking, consider pouring leftover grease or oil into a container or bowl to set aside. You can then reheat and use for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
