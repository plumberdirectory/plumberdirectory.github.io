This is so that it can attract the irons that would normally trigger rust. After extended use, these rods will ultimately become worn out and need to be changed. If you do not replace them, you could experience significant problems with your hot water heater very rapidly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>You reside in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never changed its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done soon.

This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
