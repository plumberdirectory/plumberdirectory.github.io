<p>When you have sewer or water line problems, plumbers are the people to call. Because of debris that washes in or penetration by tree roots, these lines are susceptible to damage or jeopardized function. The reality that these lines are in some cases buried can make it tough to know what the problem is. As your local Merriam plumbing pros, we are your go-to solution for kitchen plumbing problems.

People often pick to soften showers, sinks, and laundry connections. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps usually do not need to be linked to a softener. In most cases, individuals select to soften just the warm water.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any temporary or long-term connection in between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, waste disposal unit do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
