You, for that reason, have to utilize a growing number of cleaning agent to attain the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Hard minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned and disinfected during regrowth. Lastly, water containing the tough minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
