<p>These people were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had terrific reviews and a reasonable cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
<p>The cost to replace pipes under your home is merely the cost to install a new plumbing system which can vary from $2,000 to $15,000 or more.
