<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Once installed, these BPAs undergo initial and periodic testing and maintenance requirements to validate their continued functional efficiency. Such testing needs to be carried out by a state licensed Back-flow Prevention Assemble Tester signed up with the City of Austin. Licensing, registration and other tester-specific information is likewise readily available online (see Backflow Prevention Assembly Tester Info ).</p>
