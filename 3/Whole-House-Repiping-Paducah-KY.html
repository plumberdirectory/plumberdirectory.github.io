<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
