He noted that there are certain pollutants that citizens are dealing with and an RO can help ease those issues. Due to being largely agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of farming waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally occurs in some soils and that too can be corrected with the ideal RO system.</p>
