<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a feasible solution, particularly when basic plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous drawbacks to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they usually consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.
