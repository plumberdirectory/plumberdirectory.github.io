Finally, a quality contractor will not risk working with a substandard plumber. A basic error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and make complex the job with insurance claims, lost time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the best.</p>
