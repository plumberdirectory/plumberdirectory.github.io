<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a terrific man. He told me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as assured. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70.

<p>Re-piping is a procedure of replacing the water supply pipes in a house or building. It is a complete replacement of your supply plumbing system. Repiping is a process of installing a new water line plumbing system. This process normally consists of eliminating old readily accessible pipes and then installing the new plumbing system. Standard repiping jobs include installation of all brand-new hot and cold domestic water piping from the water source to all existing components and faucets. Unless specifically included in the proposition, drain replacement and components are not included.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit includes two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
