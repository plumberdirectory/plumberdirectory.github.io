It gets rid of the mineral content to produce odor free drinking water that tastes great when you include a water softener.</p>
<h3>Toilet Installation in Gilberts Illinois</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
