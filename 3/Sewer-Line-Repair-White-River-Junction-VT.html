<h3>Hiring The Services Of A Professional Plumbing Service Provider White River Junction VT</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure needs a backflow preventer or numerous gadgets, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in incredibly unusual cases where the structure is deemed to not posture a risk to the water system, should be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
