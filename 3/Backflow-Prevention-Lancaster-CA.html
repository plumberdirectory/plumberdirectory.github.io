Enzyme-Based Drain Cleaners: Like the sodium bicarbonate and vinegar mixture, an enzyme treatment will likewise keep pipes running smoothly. Enzymes are bacteria that feed upon organic matter, such as hair, mold, algae and other typical clog-causers. This natural option is safe and efficient. Contact us today at High 5 Plumbing to acquire our advised enzyme cleaner, Bioclean.</p>
<p>You may be lured to weld or spot a leak shut or replace only a single area of pipe to save cash.

With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>
