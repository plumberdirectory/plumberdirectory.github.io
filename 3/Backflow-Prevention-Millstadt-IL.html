<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
