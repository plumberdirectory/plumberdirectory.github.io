<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Lake Villa IL</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>You hear water dripping or running in the tank. A backflow occurs when water runs backwards through your pipes and into the drinking water supply. The water streaming backwards from a cross-connection may contaminate the drinking water system. Lawn irrigation systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis are common cross-connection points.
