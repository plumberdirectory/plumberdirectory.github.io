<p>The source or area of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another.

<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you very first shot using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while.
