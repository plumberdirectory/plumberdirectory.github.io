<p>The U-shaped pipe below bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people anticipate to see however rarely stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>On its own, natural gas is colorless and odorless. Most utility companies add a sulfur compound to natural gas, which is where the rotten egg odor originates from.
