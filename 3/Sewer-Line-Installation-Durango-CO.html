<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
