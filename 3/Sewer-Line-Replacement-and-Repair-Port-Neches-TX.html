<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the ideal length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if necessary, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you may have to make a time-wasting trip to the shop.

<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
