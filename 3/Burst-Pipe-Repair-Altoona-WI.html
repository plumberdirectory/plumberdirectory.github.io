<h3>The Different Kinds Of Plumbers Altoona WI</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your building needs a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in exceptionally rare cases where the structure is deemed to not position a danger to the water system, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
