Even bushes and trees can cause problems for sewer lines, particularly in older neighborhoods where clay pipe might have been used. In the cold Colorado winter seasons, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be twice as intensified if pipes have been allowed to freeze.</p>
<p>Your storm drains do not go directly into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is generally carried elsewhere to a neighboring treatment plant, a creek, and even the ocean in. Through the storm drain system there are long, flat areas of pipe that can be susceptible to clogging due to the fact that there just isn't enough a high adequate circulation to flush out the particles.</p>

<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
