<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
