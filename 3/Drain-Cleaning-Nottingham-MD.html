<p>These people were amazing! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had fantastic reviews and a fair rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it as well.</p>
