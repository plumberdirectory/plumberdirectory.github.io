However, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they usually include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
