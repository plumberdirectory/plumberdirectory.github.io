Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
