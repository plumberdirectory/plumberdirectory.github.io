The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the building; additional, more considerable costs can take place if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for locals. A PE or RA can help figure out if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>
