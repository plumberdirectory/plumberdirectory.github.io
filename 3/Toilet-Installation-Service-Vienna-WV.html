It is really hard to judge such claims, which are practically never ever based on tests that are well enough explained to enable others to assess them and to confirm the results.

<p>Plumbing is an essential part of your home or business, and its ability to function is vital. If you experience regular problems with your plumbing, like drains blocking, this might be an indication of a larger issue, like a tree root intrusion or a large clog.
