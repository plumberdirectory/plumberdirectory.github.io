It is really hard to judge such claims, which are practically never ever based on tests that are well enough explained to enable others to assess them and to confirm the results. While the absence of "clinical" evidence does not in itself revoke a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it ought to make one think twice to accept it without some guarantee of efficiency.</p>
<p>Plumbing is an essential part of your home or business, and its ability to function is vital. If you experience regular problems with your plumbing, like drains blocking, this might be an indication of a larger issue, like a tree root intrusion or a large clog.

Small obstructions can become huge ones fairly quickly.</p>
