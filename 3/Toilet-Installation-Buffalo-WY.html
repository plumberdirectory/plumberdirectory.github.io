<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to detect.</p>
