<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system.

Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
