<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Batavia NY 14020</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
