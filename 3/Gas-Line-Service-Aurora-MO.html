<p>More recent models, such as tankless water heaters, are much more energy-efficient and can help you save money on your month-to-month energy bills.

<p>Whether a water system is labelled "soft" or "tough" depends on the presence of two highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no unfavorable effects and are, in fact, necessary daily nutrients. It is minerals that give water the rejuvenating taste many people find desirable. Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they accumulation on contact surfaces, possibly plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and reduce the effectiveness of soaps and detergents. At this point the water is stated to be hard.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are set up in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
