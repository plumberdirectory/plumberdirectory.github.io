<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a garbage disposal features 2 fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
