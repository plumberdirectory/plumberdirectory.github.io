<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Call Milton Frank Plumbing & Cooling at (281) 645-5905 for professional hot water heater repair & installation services near Spring and the surrounding locations. The water in your toilet, sink, or shower drains gradually - This is the most typical indication that you have actually got a drain stoppage.

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and then return to service. Due to the fact that they restore whether the resin needs it or not, these work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, normally regrow after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such models are hassle-free.</p>
