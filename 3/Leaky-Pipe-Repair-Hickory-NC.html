<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners eliminate calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Simply put, soft water conserves you cash. Minimized Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes two separately acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and listed below the first check valve.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the home (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for most fire defense systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or debris in the water line prevents them from closing totally, backflow can take place.</p>
