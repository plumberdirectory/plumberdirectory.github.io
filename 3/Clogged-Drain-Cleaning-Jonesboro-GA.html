<p>The on-demand gas heater can save as much as 35% of the energy needed for heated water if your home utilizes around 45 gallons of hot water each day. They can also minimize the energy needed for houses with far higher needs too.

The repair may be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
