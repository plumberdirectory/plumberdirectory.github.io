<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
