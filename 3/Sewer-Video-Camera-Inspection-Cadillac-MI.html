<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each component. If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or constant) of the component, which could trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
