<p>When sewer line breaks, it often causes the yard above it to become soaked. You might smell the revolting odor of sewage prior to you feel the squish of your yard under your feet (ideally shoed feet!).

<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or short-lived connection between a public water system or consumer's potable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to clogs with food and grease being the significant perpetrators. They congeal to the piping walls if fats are poured down the sink. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls also. Even tree roots can develop major drain clogs by twisting around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water circulation, requiring plumbers to repair the issue and find for normal home plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned before it leads to additional damage and even costlier repairs if this is what is occurring to your house.</p>
