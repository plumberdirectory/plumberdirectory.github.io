<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less vital things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled.
