<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each part. If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of stable or direct) of the component, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities.

In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
