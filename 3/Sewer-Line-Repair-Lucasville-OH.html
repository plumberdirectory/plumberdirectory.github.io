<p>Aside from these two crucial elements, there are a myriad of little, maybe less important things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and then go back to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, generally restore after many gallons of water have been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such models are convenient.</p>
