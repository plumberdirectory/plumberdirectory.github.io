<p>The very best way to deal with high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego public utilities site is by installing a pressure decreasing valve (PRV). A PRV will regulate water pressure as it enters the home. According to San Diego public utilities, a PRV can also assist to save water as fixtures in the home will use less water when the pressure is at a lower and more manageable PSI.</p>
<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
