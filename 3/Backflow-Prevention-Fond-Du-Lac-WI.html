<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
