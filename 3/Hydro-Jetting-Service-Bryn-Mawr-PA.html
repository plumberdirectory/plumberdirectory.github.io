<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of flow of water which might bring dirty water or other, dangerous compounds into the general public supply of water and private plumbing.

<p>It prevails for hot water heater to leak due to changing pressure, and the temperature and pressure relief valve belongs to the unit for that exact factor. But while little drips ought to not be trigger for issue, homeowners need to watch on the hot water heater leakages. I had an excellent experience with Gotelli Plumbing when we needed a leak in a pipe fixed. Tom was professional and friendly. He also got the job done faster than initial estimated, so the work was less expensive than I anticipated. I will use Gotelli Plumbing once again in the future.</p>
