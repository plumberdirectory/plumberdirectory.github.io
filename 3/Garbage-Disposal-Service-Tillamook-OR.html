<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely concentrated service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the kind of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
