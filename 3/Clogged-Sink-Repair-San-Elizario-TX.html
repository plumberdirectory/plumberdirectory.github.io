<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient operating a necessity more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>

A simple mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and complicate the task with insurance claims, wasted time, and claims. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the very best.</p>
