<p>Bear in mind that a disposal is not like the numerous simple home enhancement projects around the house. It includes blades, a mix of electric work, and plumbing which then means a mix of electrical power and water. Mishaps involving garbage disposals are too common to put yourself at threat.

These are not just going to trigger the disposal not to work properly but are hazardous.</p>

In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly tough with high mineral content, you may need to flush the hot water heater more often.</p>
