It truly isn't a great concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have been particularly designed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or won't disperse your weight equally and could ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
