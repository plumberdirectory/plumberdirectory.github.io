<p>When you remove the cap to eliminate the valve, inspect the washer for wear or fractures. Replacing a bad washer is inexpensive and easy. But finding the ideal washer might not be. The most common washers are frequently offered at home centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be tough to discover. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the store to discover a match. Plumbers normally replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
