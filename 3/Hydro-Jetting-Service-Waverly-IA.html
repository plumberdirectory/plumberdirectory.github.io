<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and detailed plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a blockage or can trigger rust that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- In time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and removes from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
