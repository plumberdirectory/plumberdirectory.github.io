<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Contractor in West Frankfort</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that individuals anticipate to see but seldom stop to think of. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it does not grind up food, this indicates the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the garbage disposal. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates professional inserts a high-resolution camera with a light attached to it into the sewer line at your property.
