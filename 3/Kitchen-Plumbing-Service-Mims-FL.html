Our repair procedures depend on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, imperfections triggered by waste accumulation can prevent the liner from adhering to the walls appropriately. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for a thorough cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The special nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all directions to allow the water to cover the entire diameter of the sewer line and offer a cautious cleaning.</p>
