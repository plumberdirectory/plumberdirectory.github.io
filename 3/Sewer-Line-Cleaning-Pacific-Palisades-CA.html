<p>This type of valve is used on agricultural areas. It is indicated to keep the local supply of water clean in the existence of various farming pesticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals. Using these items is called chemigation. There are several elements to this valve. The check valve has a spring operated flapper, which enables flow in only one instructions.
