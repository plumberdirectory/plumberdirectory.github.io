<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
