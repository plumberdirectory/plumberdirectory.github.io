<p>Throughout sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates professional inserts a high-resolution camera with a light attached to it into the sewer line at your home. The camera is by hand controlled on a versatile rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light supplies a clear image for the professional to precisely examine conditions and detect the functionality of the pipes. The info we obtain from the inspection enables us to make an informed choice concerning the condition of your pipes and advise the best service also.

Using the images recorded by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
