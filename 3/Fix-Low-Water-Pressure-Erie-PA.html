Camera work in locating buried septic systems or checking the condition of buried pipes to figure out proper maintenance schedules or the level of necessary repairs.

<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
