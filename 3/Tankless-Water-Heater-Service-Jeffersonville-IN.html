<p>Hydro-jetting is a technique of removing build up and debris in tanks and lines by using incredibly high-pressure water to get rid of blockages. These obstructions might have been made from grease, heavy sludge, or tree roots that have built up over time. Hydro jetting's advanced innovation enables the process to be effective and fast.
