Like any house appliance, a toilet tank features numerous small moving parts that might need replaced with usage with time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear and trigger toilet leakages that aren't clearly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can also happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will eventually take its toll. If you observe that your plumbing struggles with various obstructions, leaks, and water pressure fluctuation that no quantity of repairs seems to stem, you should consult a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as a service. Homeowners should examine water pressure entering their house on a regular basis. Water pressure should be about 55 to 60 PSI; some city water pressure can can be found in at over 100 PSI.</p>
