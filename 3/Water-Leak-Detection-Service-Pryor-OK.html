<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber In Pryor OK</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a fair rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
<p>This is an indication you might need a toilet repair or replacement if you are finding yourself flushing the toilet more than regular (or even more than when). This could be an indication that the mechanism that flushes needs changed, the water jets are simply not working to flush the excrement down, or your water pressure is too low.
