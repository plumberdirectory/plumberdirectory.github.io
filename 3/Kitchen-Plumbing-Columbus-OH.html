Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
