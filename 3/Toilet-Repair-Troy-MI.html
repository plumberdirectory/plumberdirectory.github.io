<p>Our group at All Stage Plumbing also utilizes drain cleaning technology to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not include any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also known as trenchless pipe lining is a resilient and exceptional option for your damaged pipes. The pipe lining process involves our team saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. When the felt liner is completely filled, it is pushed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all flaws and fractures. If heat is utilized, the liner is left to solidify in location for several hours or 60 minutes. As soon as the procedure is total, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be inspected one more time to make sure your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
