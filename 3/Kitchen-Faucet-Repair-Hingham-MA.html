<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a requirement more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close properly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
