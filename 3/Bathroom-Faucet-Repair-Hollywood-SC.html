He kept in mind that there are specific contaminants that citizens are dealing with and an RO can help ease those issues. Due to being mostly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste.

<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
