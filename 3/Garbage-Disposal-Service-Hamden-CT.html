<p>Sewer lines have one essential function: bring wastewater out of a house or building. A lot of folks replace their hot water heater due to poor efficiency, total failure or as a preventive measure. If your hot water heater is more than ten years old, it's time to consider changing it with a more efficient model. Water on the floor can mean used parts. Your plumber may replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole.
