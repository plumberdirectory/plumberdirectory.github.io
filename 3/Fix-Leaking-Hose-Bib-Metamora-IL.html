<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a feasible option, especially when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many downsides to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they normally include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.
