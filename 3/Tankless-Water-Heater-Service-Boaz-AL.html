<p>Water solidity is the quantity of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium.

When these parts wear, they result in tiny leaks that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is necessary to call a plumber as quickly as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>

<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can easily and quickly be disposed of through the sink, this large quantity of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without restraining water flow. By setting up a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by conserving the quantity of garbage that gets sent to landfills and other dumping areas. With a garbage disposal the garbage is handled through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
