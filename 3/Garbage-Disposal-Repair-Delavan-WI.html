<p>Depending on what part of the world you're from you might have heard sink disposals referred to as garbage disposals," food waste disposers," or, if you're truly correct, a sink waste disposal unit." Whatever you call it, changing one out or installing a new one is a fairly simple job. The deal with individual mains usually takes one to 2 weeks, and service work usually takes an additional one to two weeks, though some may be carried out concurrently on a task.
