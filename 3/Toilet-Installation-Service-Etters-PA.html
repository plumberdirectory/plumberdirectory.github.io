It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had excellent evaluations and a fair cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it too.</p>
