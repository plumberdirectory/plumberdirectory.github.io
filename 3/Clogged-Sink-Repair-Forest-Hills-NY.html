<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, rust or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to discover the cause of regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
