<p>Gas is tough to detect, as it's a colorless, odor free substance. We utilize gas in our houses with gas heaters, ranges, and ovens. American homes access natural gas through miles and miles of underground pipelines. Having a gas leak from an outdoor pipeline and indoor appliances can take place quickly and all of a sudden.
