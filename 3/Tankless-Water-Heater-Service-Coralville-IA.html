<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
