<p>These guys were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had terrific reviews and a fair rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
