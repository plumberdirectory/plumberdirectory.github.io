<p>The usual solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to think about if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for lots of years, however steel eventually struggles with deterioration and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
