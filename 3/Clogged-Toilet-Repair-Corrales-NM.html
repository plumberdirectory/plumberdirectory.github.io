<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (typically from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>Rusting and deterioration on the exterior of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can suggest a potential problem with the hot water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can also imply the water heater is near the end of its life.
