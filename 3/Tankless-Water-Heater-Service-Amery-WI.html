<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and pricey plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. It was a difficult job because of the age of your house and place of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
