<p>It is not constantly due to blockages that come from inside the house when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also called tree root intrusion. When tree roots start to make their method inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems. The type of drain pipes currently installed, such as cast iron, copper, plastic or clay, will identify the degree of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>

<p>Quality sinks properly installed last for decades, so we're generally employed for kitchen and bath remodels.

<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible option, specifically when easy plunging does not appear to work. However, there are lots of downsides to utilizing these harmful products - not least of which is that they usually include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your home and household.</p>
