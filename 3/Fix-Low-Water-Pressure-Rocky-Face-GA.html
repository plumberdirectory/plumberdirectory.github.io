<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed procedure. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, procedure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might need extra adapters, versatile tubing is far easier to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal service is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced.
