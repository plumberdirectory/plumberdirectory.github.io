<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Laurinburg NC 28352</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another technique is to introduce a chemical compound that serves as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water rather than developing on surface areas. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the buildup could still happen.</p>
