<p>The typical option is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many years, however steel eventually experiences deterioration and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the very first most obvious signs of a sewer issue is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple issue such as a broken water seal, or it can show a larger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid severe damage to your home. Even if the issue originates with the community system, it's still clever to bring in the specialists to limit the damage to your home.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize as soon as backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
