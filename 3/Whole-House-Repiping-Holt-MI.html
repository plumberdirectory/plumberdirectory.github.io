<p>When they have to suit local water and sewer capacities, Garbage disposal units may cost more. The plumbing in your home should work well or backup can occur, and septic systems might need to be upgraded to deal with the disposal. Baffles: Baffles avoid silverware from going into the waste disposal unit, so you're just sending food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes 2 stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
