<p>Often triggered by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then inspect and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This indicates a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is normally the fix. Alternatively, in some cases a defective fill valve may actuate periodically, too. Water won't drain or is draining pipes gradually through the disposal.</p>
<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
