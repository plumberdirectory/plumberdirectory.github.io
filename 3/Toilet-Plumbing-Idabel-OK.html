<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener option in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully eliminate solidity from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
