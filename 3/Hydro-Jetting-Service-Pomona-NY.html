The water is constantly warmed as long as the tap remains on. The water stops being warmed if the tap is immediately changed off.

<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
