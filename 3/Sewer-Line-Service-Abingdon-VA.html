<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Abingdon VA</h3>
<p>Another typical argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The apparent problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
<p>You hear water running or dripping in the tank. A backflow occurs when water runs backward through your pipes and into the drinking water system. The water streaming backwards from a cross-connection may infect the drinking water supply. Yard irrigation systems, pool, and hot tubs prevail cross-connection points.
