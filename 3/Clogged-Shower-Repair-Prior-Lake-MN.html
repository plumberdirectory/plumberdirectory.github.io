If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom.
