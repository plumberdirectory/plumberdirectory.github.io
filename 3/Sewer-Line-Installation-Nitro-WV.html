<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Nitro WV</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the home (downstream) side exceeds the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for most fire protection systems, they do have a defect: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line avoids them from closing completely, backflow can occur.</p>
