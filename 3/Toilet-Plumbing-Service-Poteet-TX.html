<h3>Water Heater Maintenance in Poteet Texas</h2>
<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, merely link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if necessary, to insert the tube back into the tee.) You may have to make a time-wasting journey to the store if the old discharge tube is too short. To avoid this, make sure the new waste disposal unit installation package includes a tube, or buy one independently at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
