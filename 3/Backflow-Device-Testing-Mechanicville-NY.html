<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
