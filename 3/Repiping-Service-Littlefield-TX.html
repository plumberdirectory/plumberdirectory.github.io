<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and costly plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can cause rust that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and removes from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>
