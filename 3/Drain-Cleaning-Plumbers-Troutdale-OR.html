<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
