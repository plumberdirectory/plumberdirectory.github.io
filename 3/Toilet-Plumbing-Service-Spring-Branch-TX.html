<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a viable option, specifically when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they normally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your house and household.</p>
