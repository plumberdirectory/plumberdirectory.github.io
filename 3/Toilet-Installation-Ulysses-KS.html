<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each element. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide might limit the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the component, which might cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
