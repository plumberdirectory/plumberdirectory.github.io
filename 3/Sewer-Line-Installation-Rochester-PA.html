<h3>How To Select A Credible Plumber Rochester PA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your structure requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in exceptionally unusual cases where the building is deemed to not present a threat to the water supply, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
