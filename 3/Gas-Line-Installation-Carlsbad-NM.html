<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Carlsbad NM</h3>
<p>All of us experience a clogged drain at some time. You can attempt to take matters into your hands by using everyday items, such as a plunger, a coat hanger, or a snake. Some house owners will attempt to remove the clog using store-bought drain cleaners and natural natural home remedy, like vinegar or lemon juice with baking soda. These treatments do work, specifically if you are dealing with a little drain clog. However, they are normally momentary fixes that do not offer irreversible resolutions.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as hard water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
