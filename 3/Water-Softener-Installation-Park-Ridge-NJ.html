<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Park Ridge NJ 07656?</h3>
<p>Your hot water heater is among the most important aspects of your home's plumbing system Water heaters are accountable for producing all of the heated water you need for bathing, cleaning, cooking, and taking care of other daily jobs.

<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
