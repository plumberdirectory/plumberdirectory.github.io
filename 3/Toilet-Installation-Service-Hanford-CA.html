Whole-house repiping can definitely be a large undertaking, which is why the service is just performed when absolutely essential.

<p>Whether a water system is identified "soft" or "tough" depends on the existence of two extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium.

The factor it is used in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
