Vegetables and fruit peels can also cause jams and obstructions - think about composting or putting these items in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can harden and collect in your drain also. After completing cooking, think about pouring leftover grease or oil into a jar or bowl to set aside. You can then reheat and use for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
