<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the salt water tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank runs out of salt, the water passing through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
