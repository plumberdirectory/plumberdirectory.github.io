I picked this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job cleaning up after it too.</p>
