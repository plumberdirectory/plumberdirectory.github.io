Once it has passed through the valve, a backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve arrangement designed to avoid the turnaround of the circulation of water.

<p>Introduced more than a decade ago, Uponor ProPEX fittings remain the best technique for making water tight Uponor PEX-a connections fast and easy. Capitalizing on the unique, thermal shape memory of Uponor's PEX-a tubing, fittings actually get stronger in time. No need to worry about behind-the-wall connections - ProPEX joints will last the life of the building.</p>
