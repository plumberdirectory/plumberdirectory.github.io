<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific guy. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as assured. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay may be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
