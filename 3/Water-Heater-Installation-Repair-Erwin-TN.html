<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Erwin TN</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your building requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in very uncommon cases where the building is considered to not pose a danger to the supply of water, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
