<p>As a locally-owned company, integrity and duty are extremely important to building a credibility for excellence. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the safe and clean water supply within a building these gadgets are called isolation" BFP.

The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no other way to provide one, then we examine to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
