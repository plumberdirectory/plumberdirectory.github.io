<p>Bear in mind that a disposal is not like the lots of simple home enhancement projects around your home.

Thinking about the life expectancy of a disposal, it would also be unnecessarily expensive to buy all the materials and tools needed for the job.

<p>A rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, say, you need a new burner package and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>

It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had great evaluations and a reasonable price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it also.</p>
