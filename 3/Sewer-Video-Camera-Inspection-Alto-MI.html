Water pressure might be or stop working minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
