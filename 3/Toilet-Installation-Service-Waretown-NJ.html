<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capability and can't bring in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer system calculates the quantity of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately starts. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regeneration generally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: Difficult water stops your washing detergent from working efficiently since difficult water ions can bond with cleaning agent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to use more and more cleaning agent to attain the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Difficult minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with sodium ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and disinfected during regeneration. Lastly, water consisting of the tough minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
