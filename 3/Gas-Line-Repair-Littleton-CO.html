<p>Keep in mind that repiping a house is a major plumbing repair, and you ought to just work with a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to ensure that the job is done right. The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, costs vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg.

<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200).
