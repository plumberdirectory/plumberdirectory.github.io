<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy salt water option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank lacks salt, the water travelling through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>

<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
