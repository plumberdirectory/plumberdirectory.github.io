Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a challenging job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working prior to they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
