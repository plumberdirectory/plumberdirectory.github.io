<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Some producers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promo have actually been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
