This is a choice to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many decades, but steel eventually suffers from deterioration and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

The deal with individual mains typically takes one to two weeks, and service work typically takes an additional one to two weeks, though some might be performed concurrently on a job. Nevertheless, the gas to your home will just have to be turned off for a brief period of time (generally less than 4 hours).</p>
