<p>Determining if you need a water softener is an individual choice. Water softener systems work by removing firmness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener option in areas where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently remove firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
