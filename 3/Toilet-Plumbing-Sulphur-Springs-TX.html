<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
