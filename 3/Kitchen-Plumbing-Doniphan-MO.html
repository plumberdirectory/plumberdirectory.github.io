<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other areas of your home. A sewage odor emanating from your bathroom or another area of your home can be an indication of a major problem with your plumbing. Pipes in your house might have burst or otherwise broken. If there is a consistent sewage odor in your house, it is important that you get in touch with a certified plumber. Raw sewage is really unsafe and can posture serious health threats.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the offender. However not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack ideal.</p>
<p>Typically caused by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then examine and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This shows a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is normally the fix. Additionally, in some cases a malfunctioning fill valve may activate periodically, as well.
