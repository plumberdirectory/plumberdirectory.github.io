<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Hyannis MA</h3>

When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
