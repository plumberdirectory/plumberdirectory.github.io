<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
