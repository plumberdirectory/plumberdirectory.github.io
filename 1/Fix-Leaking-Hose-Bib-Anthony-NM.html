<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the building; additional, more substantial costs can take place if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for residents. If installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help determine.</p>

The plumbing in your house should work well or backup can occur, and septic systems may need to be updated to work with the disposal.
