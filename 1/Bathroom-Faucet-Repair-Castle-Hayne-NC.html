You, therefore, have to use more and more cleaning agent to attain the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Difficult minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned and sanitized throughout regrowth. Finally, water consisting of the difficult minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
