<p>When a natural gas line is burst, it immediately becomes a major security danger. Without being repaired as rapidly as possible, it might cause quite a bit of damage if the gas inside ends up being sparked. The very first concern is to turn off the supply of natural gas and call the energy company if a person realizes that they have burst a gas line.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this method, you understand the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
