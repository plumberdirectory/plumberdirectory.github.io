<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies East Jordan MI</h3>
<p>The most effective method to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the property (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for many fire security systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line prevents them from closing entirely, backflow can happen.</p>
