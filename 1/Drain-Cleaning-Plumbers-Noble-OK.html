Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself.

<p>In water circulation systems, water is generally maintained at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may fail or be decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
