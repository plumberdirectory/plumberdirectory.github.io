<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
