<p>If you have actually constantly lived in an area with hard water, you may not recognize how much it affects you-- however if you've recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too aware of the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from tough water. Difficult water interferes with the lathering of soaps and shampoos, triggering you to use more. Difficult water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that difficult water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden often.</p>

If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
