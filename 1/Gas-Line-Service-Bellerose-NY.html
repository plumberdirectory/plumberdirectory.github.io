For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more quickly.

If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
