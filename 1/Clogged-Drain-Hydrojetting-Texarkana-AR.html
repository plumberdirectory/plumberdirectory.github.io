<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply.

Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
