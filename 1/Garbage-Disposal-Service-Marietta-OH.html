<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar brand-new one is less complex than changing with a various model. So, if you are not looking specifically for a different disposal this might be something to think about. A totally various disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink port needs to be puttied into place. A safe and secure seal is a must. When connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is connected. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, taking care to connect wires accurately, and the base covered to secure the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
<p>Do not utilize ground joint unions other than directly at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the home appliance. Each location where you will have a gas home appliance need to have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle only, anybody who sets up gas piping on property not under their ownership must have a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping installations require a permit and inspection.</p>
