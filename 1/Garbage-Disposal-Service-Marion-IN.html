<p>Central Ohio Gas Line Services LLC focuses on the installation and repair of residential and commercial natural gas and propane gas lines, water service lines, gas line troubleshooting and assessment services.

<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
