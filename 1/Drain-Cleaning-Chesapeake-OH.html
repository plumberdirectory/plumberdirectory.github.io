<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible option, especially when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your house and family.</p>
