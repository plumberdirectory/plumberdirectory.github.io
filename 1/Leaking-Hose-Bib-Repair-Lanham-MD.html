<p>Agilent's series of leak detection solutions guarantee the security, security and consistent efficiency of research, vacuum, and industrial process systems. An alternate to repiping services is pipe relining. This process involves coating Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to avoid leakages and rust within the line. The epoxy forms a barrier between the inside of the material and the pipe flowing through it. This repair approach is better for pipes that are not made from galvanized metals.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this certification. I have actually checked with a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the rate to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
