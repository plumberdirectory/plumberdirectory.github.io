<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required.

The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
