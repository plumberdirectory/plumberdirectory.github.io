<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Brownsville TX</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
