<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and pricey plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can trigger rust that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Sound-- With time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets tough and removes from the capacity of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
