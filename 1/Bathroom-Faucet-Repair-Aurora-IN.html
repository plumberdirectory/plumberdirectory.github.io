The salt water tank holds a highly focused option of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the salt water tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank.

If the salt water tank lacks salt, the water going through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
