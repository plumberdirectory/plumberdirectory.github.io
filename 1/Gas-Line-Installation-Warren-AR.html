<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Warren AR</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure requires a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in incredibly rare cases where the building is deemed to not pose a danger to the water system, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
