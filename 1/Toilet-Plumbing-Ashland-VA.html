<h3>How To Install A Sand Trap Drain Ashland VA</h3>
<p>The most effective way to resolve hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water softeners typically have a life-span of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are effectively maintained. Making sure the brine tank never ever lacks salt will extend the unit's life.  Securing the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will likewise secure the system. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange performance. Resin cleaners enhance the regeneration cycle and aid relieve the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
