<p>Having your plumbing frequently examined is a key element of preventative maintenance. Nevertheless, many property owners and entrepreneur have an out of sight, out of mind" approach to plumbing and do not evaluate their pipes up until there is a pushing issue.

<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
