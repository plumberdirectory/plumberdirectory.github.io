<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an extremely pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is typically the culprit. However not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely. A chain with insufficient slack can cause difficulty too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack ideal.</p>
<p>It typically represents rust and mineral accumulation if you notice low water pressure or discolored water.
