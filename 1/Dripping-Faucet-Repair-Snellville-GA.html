<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each part. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide might limit the motion (instead of steady or direct) of the part, which might trigger the element to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
