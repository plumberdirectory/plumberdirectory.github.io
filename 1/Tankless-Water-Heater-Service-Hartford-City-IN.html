It is important that the plumbing system be turned on really slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to ensure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
