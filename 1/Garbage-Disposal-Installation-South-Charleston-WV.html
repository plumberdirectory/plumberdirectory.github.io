<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In South Charleston WV</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had terrific reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
