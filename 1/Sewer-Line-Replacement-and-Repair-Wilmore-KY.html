<p>There's a good chance you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This deterioration can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have numerous negative impacts on your health. Corroded pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>

And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for as much as 2 hours and $175 per hour for each extra hour.</p>
