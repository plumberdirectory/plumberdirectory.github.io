<p>There's an excellent possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to corrode.

<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a viable solution, particularly when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are numerous downsides to utilizing these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your home and household.</p>
