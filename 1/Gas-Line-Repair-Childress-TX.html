<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over a time period the within lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a little pinhole leak will develop.

<p>You might be lured to weld or patch a leak shut or replace just a single section of pipe to conserve cash. While this may operate in the short term, remember that the weakened pipe is made from the very same material as other pipes in your house, implying that trouble could be brewing elsewhere in your plumbing system. Repiping now will offer you comfort and prevent bigger leakages down the road.</p>
