All replacements should be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the proper kind of assembly based on the conditions on your property (see section listed below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Furthermore, the assembly must fulfill the lead free requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 1 month, all water services will be terminated until the assembly remains in compliance.</p>

<p>Martens Plumbing & Heating offers a variety of sewer and drain piping repair and replacement services. A clogged sewer line can result in a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can trigger significant problems and damage-- specifically typical in older homes.

<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a fixed schedule and then return to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they regenerate whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally restore after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are convenient if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
