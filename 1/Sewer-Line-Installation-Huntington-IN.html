It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
