<p>Backflow preventers are a fairly easy system, in spite of their importance. Most of commercial usage backflow prevention setups use a valve system that gets in touch with the irrigation line within your business, where irrigation meets the main water supply. From here, the preventer can keep an eye on the movement of water within your system, and prevent any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that might be triggered by malfunctioning plumbing devices. This ensures that water within lawn sprinkler, water pumps, and other irrigation and wastewater systems remains disconnected from clean" water.</p>
