Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and takes away from the capability of your water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>

The reason you can feel the distinction on your skin is since soap responds with the calcium to form soap scum. This results in the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean.
