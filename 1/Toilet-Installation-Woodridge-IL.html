These crystals are tiny and circulation normally through the water. Unlike with a softener that uses ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not need continuous regeneration.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer system determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener.
