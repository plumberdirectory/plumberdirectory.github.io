<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, state, you need a brand-new burner set and the water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more uncertain the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>

<p>These men were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had great evaluations and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it also.</p>
