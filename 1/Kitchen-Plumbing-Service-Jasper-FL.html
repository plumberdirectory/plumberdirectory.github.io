<p>3. Solar Salt comes from evaporated seawater and may in some cases leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in tubs and sinks. The pink movie is really a harmless germs that originates from the sea salt. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommends changing to one of the other two types of salts if this stain is an annoyance in your house.

<p>Drain obstructions in bathroom sinks can happen with time from the buildup of hair, bits of soap and fibers from towels that accumulates within pipes. As a clog ends up being bigger over time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining pipes correctly. You can fight hard water in different methods, consisting of filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, adding a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (sodium carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
<p>Gently listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's changed correctly (Photo 8). You don't have to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
