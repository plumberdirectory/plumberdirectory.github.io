<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Sterling MA</h3>
<p>To determine if your home is a poly house," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are usually blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it gets in the home near the water heater. Your main turned off is attached to the end of the water main. Make certain you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe gets in the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Tankless systems heat water as needed instead of all the time, just like older-style tank water heaters. You can also get hot water more quickly than with traditional heaters. With a new tankless hot water heater, you'll never run out of warm water - the whole household can take showers while you're washing the meals and doing laundry and the hot water will simply keep streaming.</p>

<p>The pipe-bursting method is utilized on pipes that are severely harmed, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for fixing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes 2 four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be impervious to root intrusion for approximately 100 years.</p>
