<p>Surface Accelerated Formation is an innovation that simulates biomineralization, the system typically acknowledged for structured growth in the environment, including seashells. Water softening is achieved with SACr by using proprietary polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads accelerate the development of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to completely remove short-lived solidity in water.</p>
<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with house owners in the area. He noted that there are certain impurities that residents are dealing with and an RO can help alleviate those issues. Due to being largely farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally happens in some soils and that too can be remedied with the best RO system.</p>
