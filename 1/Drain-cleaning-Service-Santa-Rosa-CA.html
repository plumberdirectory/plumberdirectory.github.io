Sanford & Son plumbing provides sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas. During regrowth, salty water from the salt water tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>

Profiting from the unique, thermal shape memory of Uponor's PEX-a tubing, fittings actually get more powerful over time. No need to worry about behind-the-wall connections - ProPEX joints will last the life of the building.</p>
