<p>The pipe-bursting method is utilized on pipes that are severely damaged, for changing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes two 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic product that will be impervious to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
