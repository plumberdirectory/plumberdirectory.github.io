<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
