<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by getting rid of solidity minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener option in locations where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently remove firmness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
