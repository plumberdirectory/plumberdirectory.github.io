<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>

<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally preserved at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may fail or be decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water supply (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
