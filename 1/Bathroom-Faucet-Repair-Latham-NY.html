<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Latham NY</h3>
<p>These guys were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had great reviews and a fair rate, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it too.</p>
