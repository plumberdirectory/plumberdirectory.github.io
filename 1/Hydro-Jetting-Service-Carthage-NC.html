Appropriate drainage must also be provided.</p>

First, plans for each device to be installed need to be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which may use up to 3 weeks or more to authorize and process. Declined plans should be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can include another numerous weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to avoid winter freezing. The brand-new pipe, made from a high-tech, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls.

Depending on the scope of work being carried out and the kind of building, you may have several inspections.</p>
