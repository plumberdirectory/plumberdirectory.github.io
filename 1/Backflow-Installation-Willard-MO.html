<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually typically been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mostly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening simply removes hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a nuisance and not a danger to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not need. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
