<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive inventory of backflow valves and related gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the basic structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is also a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to spot.</p>
