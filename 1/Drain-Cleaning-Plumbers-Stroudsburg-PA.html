<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will liquify in it less easily. Water softening can prevent these unfavorable results. Natural gas is a colorless, odor free fuel. As a safety preventative measure, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives gas a smell typically related to rotten eggs. If it occurs, this unique aroma allows you to smell a potential leak. If you presume a leak, always leave.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can happen when there is an unexpected decrease in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as throughout fire battling or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This reversal can produce a suction result and draw potential impurities into the potable (drinking) water supply. Tank water heaters are typically found in a lot of houses. Their components are an insulated tank, normally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water until it's needed. A pipe emerges from the top to deliver warm water to its destination, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
