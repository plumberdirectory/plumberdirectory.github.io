<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide.

If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide could limit the movement (instead of constant or direct) of the component, which could trigger the part to not work to its abilities.
