<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
