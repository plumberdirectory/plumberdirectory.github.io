The installation must be examined to ensure it does not prevent the operations of the assembly. Test data need to be built up to determine the functions of each element. The backflow prevention assembly should be taken apart and parts changed with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly should be tested again to be sure it was effectively fixed. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the makers flow diagram is necessary to guarantee it was fixed appropriately. An effectively repaired assembly should provide years of security.</p>

<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
