<p>Clark's Process: This procedure is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which triggers the firmness ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 should be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back.
