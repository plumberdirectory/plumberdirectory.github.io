<p>You live in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never changed its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and wear away when they get old. If so, you might need to include a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you do not already have one. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>

However, when the issue is found in pipes throughout your home, it might be time to consider whole-house repiping. Few house owners are thrilled with the idea of replacing all their pipes, however handling the task prior to the plumbing system fails allows you to prevent substantial home damage.</p>
