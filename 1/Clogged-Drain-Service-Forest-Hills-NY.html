A licensed professional can help you determine if your building needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in incredibly uncommon cases where the building is deemed to not position a risk to the water supply, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
