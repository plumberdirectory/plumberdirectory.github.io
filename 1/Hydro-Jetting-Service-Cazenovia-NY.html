<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Assures? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result.
