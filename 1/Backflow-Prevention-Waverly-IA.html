<p>Don't put everything down your garbage disposal. It is essential to watch what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when combined with water, and possibly trigger a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can also trigger jams and clogs - consider composting or positioning these products in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can collect and congeal in your drain as well. After completing cooking, consider pouring remaining grease or oil into a container or bowl to reserve. You can then utilize and reheat for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>

<p>Provided there isn't a tank failure, generally a commercial hot water heater can be repaired, but is it worth fixing?

<p>This is a bad sign. Toilets must definitely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps compromise the structural integrity of the house.</p>
