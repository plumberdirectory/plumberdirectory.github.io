<p>It is not always due to clogs that come from inside the house when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to become clogged due to tree roots, also called tree root invasion. When tree roots begin to make their way inside somebody's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems. The kind of drain pipes currently installed, such as cast iron, clay, copper or plastic, will determine the level of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
