<p>Many homeowners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their clogged or dirty drain issues.

<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first shot using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. A number of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the proper preventative measures if utilizing one of these items.</p>
