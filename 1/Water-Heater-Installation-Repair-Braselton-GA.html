<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Service in Braselton</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation. I have actually consulted a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the rate to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
