<p>Backflow Preventers are an essential element of any plumbing project with the function of keeping potable water separate from any potential dangers through several applications. We provide a variety of types of Backflow Preventers, consisting of Reduced Pressure Zone (RPZ) Assemblies, Vacuum Breakers, Dual Checks, and Check Valve Assemblies, along with accompanying test enclosures, valves, and sets.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
