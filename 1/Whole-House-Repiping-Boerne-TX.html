<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
