In this approach, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get sped up.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a gas line may be covered if it is burst. If a contractor is working on an individual's landscaping and inadvertently burst a line, this type of scenario may occur.
