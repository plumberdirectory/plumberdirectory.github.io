<p>The average plumber's hourly wage is $68-$ 138. Often times easy repairs, such as unclogging a toilet or a drain, will have a fixed rate of about $220 unless there are extenuating scenarios. The cost to snake a drain is from $3-$ 13. Some plumbers will charge a cost to take a look at your circumstance and tell you what requires to be done, but if you hire them, that charge will be subtracted from the costs. A plumber may charge $50-$ 100 to come and detect the issue. 2 Needing to call a plumber after hours, on the weekend, or on a vacation will cost more.</p>
