It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air should be gotten rid of from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will build up.</p>
