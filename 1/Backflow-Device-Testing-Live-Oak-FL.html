<p>A rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, state, you need a brand-new burner package and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak.
