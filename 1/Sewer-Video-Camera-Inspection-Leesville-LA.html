Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
