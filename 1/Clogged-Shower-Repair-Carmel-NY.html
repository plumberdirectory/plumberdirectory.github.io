<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a viable solution, particularly when easy plunging does not appear to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they usually contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your home and family.</p>
