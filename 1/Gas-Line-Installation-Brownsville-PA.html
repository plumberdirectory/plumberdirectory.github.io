<h3>Clogged Kitchen Sink in Brownsville Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>If the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan, a guideline of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a new burner package and the water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
<p>If you see absolutely nothing obvious, place the wrench into the motor spline, found at the bottom of the unit, and twist right and left. Inspect that the circuit breaker hasn't tripped and then try the reset button if the motor spins easily. If these steps don't work, and your disposer's warranty has expired, it's time to replace it.</p>
