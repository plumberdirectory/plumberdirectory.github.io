<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the flow of water pushing them down your pipes.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>
