It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had great evaluations and a fair cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job cleaning up after it also.</p>
