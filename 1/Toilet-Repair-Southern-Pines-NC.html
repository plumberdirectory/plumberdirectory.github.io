<p>Sewer lines have one important role: carry wastewater out of a home or structure. Most folks replace their hot water heater due to bad performance, total failure or as a preventive measure. If your hot water heater is more than 10 years old, it's time to think about replacing it with a more efficient model. Water on the floor can indicate used parts. Your plumber might replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole. Compared to the day-to-day expenditures and aggravations sustained by tough water, a water softener is eventually a financial investment that will conserve you a substantial amount of money. The cost of the water softener system is considerably exceeded by the cash and energy conserved.</p>

Utilizing the images captured by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>There are 2 broad classifications of sources of possible cross contamination: internal and external.
