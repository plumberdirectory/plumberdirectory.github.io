Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Property owners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when offering or purchasing an older house.</p>
