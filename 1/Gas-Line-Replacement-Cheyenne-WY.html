<p>Another common misperception is that calcium-carbonate scale is an efficient type of corrosion control. There is a lack of clinical evidence supporting this claim, however. Scale does not form in uniform homogeneous layers that would secure pipe from rust Scale can be permeable or soft and is extremely irregular. Deterioration can still take place under conditions that are favorable to the development of hard-water scale or perhaps when hard-water scale is already present.</p>
<p>The very best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered up; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the dead giveaways of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, effectively sized holes in studs, joists, and floors. Finally, a quality contractor will not danger dealing with an inferior plumber. An easy mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floors and complicate the task with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and claims. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to just the very best.</p>
