If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Soap - Soap develops down the drain because they usually include grease and fat. When the fat of the soap integrates with mineral water, it forms a strong residue and sticks to the pipes, obstructing them. Call and schedule a follow up inspection by an EBMUD Backflow Inspector to verify that assembly is properly set up. The toilet is the most used plumbing fixture in your home. The regular use of your toilet implies that plumbing problems will need your timely attention.
