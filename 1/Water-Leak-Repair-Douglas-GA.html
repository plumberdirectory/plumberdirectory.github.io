<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode.

The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
