<p>No other room in a house consists of as numerous pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. Prevention is much better than remedy. If you have a well or a watering system, you need to install a backflow device on your water system. Discolored water- Your water ought to constantly be clear. Discolored water suggests rust in your pipes or water heater. This warrants professional attention if your water is an unusual color.
