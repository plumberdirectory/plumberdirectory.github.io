<p>Drain cleaning is an effective method to remove any obstructions, or particles that have actually built up in your plumbing system. However, there are specific scenarios when a cleaning might not be enough to get your drains back up and running appropriately.

If you believe you may be in need of a repair, reach out to our Jonesboro drain service experts today.</p>
<p>Letters are sent to residential customers with recognized backflow gadgets on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis. Rotate the disposal system to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then connect it. Depending upon the existing trap setup, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>Carefully raise the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. If the water shuts off, you may be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). Bend the float arm if there is no change screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's adjusted appropriately (Photo 8). You don't need to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal guarantees that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's understanding, waste disposal unit do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features 2 stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind versus a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
