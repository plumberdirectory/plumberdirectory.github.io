<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
