<p>In water circulation systems, water is normally kept at a substantial pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might fail or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
