<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>
