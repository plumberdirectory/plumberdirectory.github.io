<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>

Rejected plans need to be modified and resubmitted to the DEP approval line, which can add another several weeks to the timeline.</p>
