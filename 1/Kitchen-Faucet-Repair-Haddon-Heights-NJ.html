For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
