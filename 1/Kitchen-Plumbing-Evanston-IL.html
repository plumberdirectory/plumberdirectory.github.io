<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
