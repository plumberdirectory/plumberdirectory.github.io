<p>It is approximated that the average person spends over 3 years of their life resting on the toilet, and numerous bathroom readers are at risk of ending up being permanently attached to the fixture. Which is why choosing a comfortable, well-made toilet seat is very crucial. However, you have to make sure your toilet seat actually fits your toilet. Most of toilets are basic sized - meaning a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and comfort. Some toilets, however, have distinctively shaped bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It truly isn't a good concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to little, unless they have actually been particularly created to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or won't disperse your weight uniformly and might ultimately trigger fractures in the bowl.</p>
