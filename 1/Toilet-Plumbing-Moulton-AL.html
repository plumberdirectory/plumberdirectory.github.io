An example is the piping between a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply and an auxiliary water supply, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you very first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. Much of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely hazardous if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable safety measures.</p>
