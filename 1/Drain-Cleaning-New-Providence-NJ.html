<h3>Unclog Drains, Toilets and Sewers With The Help of Plumbers in New Providence NJ 07974</h3>

<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this technique, you know the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
