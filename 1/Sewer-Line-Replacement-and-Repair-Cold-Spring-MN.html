Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
