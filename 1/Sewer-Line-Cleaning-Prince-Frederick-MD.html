<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
