<p>Aside from these two important elements, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less vital things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>

The plumbing in the house should work well or backup can take place, and septic tanks might need to be updated to deal with the disposal.
