It might cause it to jam and not work correctly if bones or other tough foods get stuck in the disposal. By running warm water through the disposal, you may be able to clear the clog yourself. Nevertheless you run the risk of harming the motor or blades.</p>
<p>However, you also need to consider the age of your unit. If your system is getting near 10 years old, it's typically not wise to pay for repairs if they deserve more than 50 percent of the cost of a brand-new unit. It is advised that you have the garbage disposal changed if problems become more frequent with an older system.
