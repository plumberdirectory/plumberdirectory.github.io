<p>The next criteria to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair specialist understands the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

If your house was constructed before the 1970s, we strongly advise that you work with a plumbing professional to inspect your home's plumbing and inspect if there are locations that need repiping. If your house was built years prior to that, opportunities are that your house might need comprehensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can operate at optimal rates.</p>

The brand-new pipes that are used are usually made from copper since of their toughness and other aspects. Repiping is mostly done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and made out of galvanized metals.</p>
