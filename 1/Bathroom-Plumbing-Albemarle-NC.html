<p>Double Check Valve (DCV) - safe for use both inside your home and underground, DCVs are a little more pricey but are likewise extremely hassle-free, as they can be set up horizontally or vertically. Video cameras are useful in locating buried septic tanks or inspecting the condition of buried pipes to identify proper maintenance schedules or the extent of required repairs.

<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
