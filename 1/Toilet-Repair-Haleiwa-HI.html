The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For several installs, costs vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg.

<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with homeowners in the area. He noted that there are particular impurities that locals are handling and an RO can help minimize those concerns. Due to being mostly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally occurs in some soils and that too can be treated with the ideal RO system.</p>
