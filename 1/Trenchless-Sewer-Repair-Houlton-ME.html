<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc designed and built a smaller design that operated on the very same principle but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
