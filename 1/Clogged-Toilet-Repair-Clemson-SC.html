<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
