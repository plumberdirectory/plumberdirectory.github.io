<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed correctly, the guide could limit the motion (instead of stable or direct) of the component, which could cause the part to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
