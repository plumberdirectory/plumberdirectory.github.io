<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the offender. However not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger problem too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>A variety of organizations, such as the American Water Functions Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) provide certification courses designed to train experts to check backflow preventers. Requirements for training differ by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers needs knowledge of installation requirements, although inspectors are not needed to end up being certified.</p>
