<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
