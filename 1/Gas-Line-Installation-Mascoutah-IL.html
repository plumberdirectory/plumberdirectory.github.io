<p>Drawbacks to be familiar with is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well.

Also, hybrids need as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
