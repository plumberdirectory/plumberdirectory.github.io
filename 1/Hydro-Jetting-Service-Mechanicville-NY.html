<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
