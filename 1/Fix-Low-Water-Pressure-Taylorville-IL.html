<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
