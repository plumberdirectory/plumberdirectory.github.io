<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
