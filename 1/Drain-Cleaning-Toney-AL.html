<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Toney AL</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
