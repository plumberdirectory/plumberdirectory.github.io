<p>You are responsible for repairing or changing the assembly within 30 days if your assembly stops working the yearly test. All replacements need to be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the proper kind of assembly based on the conditions on your property (see area listed below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Moreover, the assembly must meet the lead free requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 1 month, all water services will be terminated till the assembly is in compliance.</p>
