<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification.

<p>Galvanized metal, is just an easier method of saying zinc covered" and what triggers galvanized pipes to rust is the exposure to too much water and minerals. You may be thinking that it does not make sense to utilize a pipe that reacts with water as your home's main source of water transport, and you would be right. Nevertheless, when the majority of these pipes were being installed, nobody understood this was going to be the result. Luckily, there are a great deal of other piping alternatives nowadays including copper.</p>
<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
