<p>Many softeners have a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to provide some type of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're working on installing it.

<p>Think about all the areas water flows in and out of your house. These are the areas that a professional evaluation must cover.
