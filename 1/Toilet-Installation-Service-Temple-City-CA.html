During regrowth, salty water from the salt water tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>The typical option is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to consider if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing.

This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or swamp gas.
