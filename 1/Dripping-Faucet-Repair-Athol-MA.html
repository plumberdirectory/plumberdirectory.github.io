<p>Irrigation backflow devices are developed for installation on drinkable water lines to secure against both back-siphonage and back-pressure of polluted water into the drinkable supply of water.

A clogged sewer pipe might leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning rip-off.</p>

<p>As soon as the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut down stays in the closed position.

A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>
