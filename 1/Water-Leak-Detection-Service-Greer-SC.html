<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Greer SC 29651</h3>
<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are checked for leakages or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them changed right away. Before you can request an inspection, you need to initially get the needed permit( s) for the work you intend to do. You can take a look at our License page for additional information on acquiring a license. Once you get a permit you can commence with the work. However, you need to call for inspection before you cover or hide any work.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Usually, the cost to replace a toilet ranges between $ 122 and $228, with the majority of homeowners spending around $ 150 to $180. This does not consist of the cost of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for an overall toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with extra functions can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The typical installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're changing an existing toilet, include $ 30 to $50 to eliminate your old toilet.</p>
