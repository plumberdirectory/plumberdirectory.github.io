<h3>Helpful Tips For Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Franklin KY</h3>
<p>Contrary to what numerous think, having a garbage disposal in fact secures your pipes and extends their life expectancy. Food washed down a drain accidentally or on function without a disposal can get stuck in pipe turns, causing clogs and slowly damaging your plumbing system. Tiny food particles developed by a garbage disposal wash straight down easily.</p>
<p>This is very essential! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to push the waste out of your drain system. Current guidelines limit the quantity of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We offer two types of water treatment systems for tough water: Benefit Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
