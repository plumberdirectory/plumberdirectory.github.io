<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each component. If the part is not repaired appropriately, the guide could limit the motion (instead of stable or direct) of the part, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
