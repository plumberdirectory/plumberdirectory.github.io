The factors for this can range from leaks, malfunctioning or malfunctioning electrical wiring, or a broken heating component or thermostat. If it is one of the discussed issues, a repair or replacement of the components might suffice.

<p>Letters are sent out to residential customers with known backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code needs a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, pool, and hot tubs.

Depending upon the existing trap configuration, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
