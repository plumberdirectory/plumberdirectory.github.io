<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing set up throughout building and construction of a brand-new or renovated structure is installed by knowledgeable craftsmen in accordance with suitable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you wash your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you typically know your drain is clogged and needs cleaning.
