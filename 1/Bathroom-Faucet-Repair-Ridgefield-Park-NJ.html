Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
