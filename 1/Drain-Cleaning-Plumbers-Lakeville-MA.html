If passes and leaves the softener through your house's pipes and plumbing, note that copper can reenter the water after.

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages.
