<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best option depends upon the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, generally regenerate after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. Such models are practical if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
