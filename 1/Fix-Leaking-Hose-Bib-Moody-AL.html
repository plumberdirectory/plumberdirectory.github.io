<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of keeping the integrity and efficiency of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace solidity ions, also has a favorable charge, so none of these ions are brought in to each other.

<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are created to provide decades of protection. There are lots of regional conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.

Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will collect.</p>
<p>Whether a water supply is labelled "soft" or "difficult" is dependent on the existence of 2 highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium.
