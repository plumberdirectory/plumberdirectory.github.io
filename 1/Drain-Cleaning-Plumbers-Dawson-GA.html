<p>When the potable supply piping is linked to a system or component which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure might occur. Greater pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as skyscrapers or tanks. Potable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system if these connections are not properly protected.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the majority of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be completed will come out of the pocketbook of a house owner. Plumbing Codes and State law determine minimum standards for backflow prevention. Public water supply such as the City Utilities Department need to meet or exceed the state standards and carry the obligation for imposing them.</p>
