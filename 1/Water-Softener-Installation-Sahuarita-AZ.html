Invasive tree roots can cause significant plumbing problems, especially in older neighborhoods with clay sewer lines.</p>
<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank can be found in. An on-board computer computes the quantity of water that flows through the softener.
