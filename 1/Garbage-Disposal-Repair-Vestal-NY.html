<p>The calcium from limestone is the major contributor to the firmness of Woodbury's water.

<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
