Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend natural items, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work much better than products consisting of extreme chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
