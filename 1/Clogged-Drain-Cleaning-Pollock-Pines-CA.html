<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are looked for leaks or damage. How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed immediately. Before you can ask for an inspection, you need to first obtain the required authorization( s) for the work you intend to do.

<p>Replacing the old disposal with an identical brand-new one is less complex than changing with a different design. So, if you are not looking specifically for a various disposal this might be something to think about. An entirely different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink port has to be puttied into place. A safe seal is a must.
