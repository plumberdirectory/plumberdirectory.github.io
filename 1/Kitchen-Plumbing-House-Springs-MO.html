<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling.

Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an exceptionally pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
