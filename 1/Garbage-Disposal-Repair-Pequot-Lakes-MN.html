Some toilets, however, have distinctively formed bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It truly isn't a good idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have been particularly designed to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to move around, or won't distribute your weight evenly and could ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
