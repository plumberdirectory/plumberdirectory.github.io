<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
