<p>The source or place of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their property line.

<p>Downsides to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heat pump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to capture adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
