<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Dallas GA 30157</h3>
<p>Aside from these 2 essential parts, there are a myriad of small, possibly less crucial things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
