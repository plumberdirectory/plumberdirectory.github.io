<p>Leaks - Next, leakages represent the most common cause for kitchen sink repair. Generally, they begin small and go undetected, and after time can result in big puddles beneath your sink and cabinets. This type results in possible water damage. Many other types of leaky kitchen sinks which are irritating however are typically repaired quickly.
