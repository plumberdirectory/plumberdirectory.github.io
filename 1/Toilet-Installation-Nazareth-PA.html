<p>Aside from these two essential components, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less important things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
