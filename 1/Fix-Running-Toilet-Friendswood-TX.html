This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

<p>Pieces that make up kitchen sink drains can become corroded and used, leading to leaks. Depending on the intensity of the situation, only one piece might need replacement, or the entire under-sink assembly needs to be removed and changed. Elements involved consist of slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Poorly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not secured by nut joints and washers, should be reconfigured.</p>
