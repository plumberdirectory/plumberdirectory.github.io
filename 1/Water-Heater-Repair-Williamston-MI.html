<p>Due to the fact that of the fundamental design of a decreased pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on an incredibly low circulation or fixed flow condition may cause nuisance dripping and potential fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure consistent to the assembly in times of changing supply pressure.</p>
