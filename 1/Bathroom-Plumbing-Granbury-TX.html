<p>Aside from these 2 crucial elements, there are a myriad of little, maybe less critical things that can deteriorate or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
