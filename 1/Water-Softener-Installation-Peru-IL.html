These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
