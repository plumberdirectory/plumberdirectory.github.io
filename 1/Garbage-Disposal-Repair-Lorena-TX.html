Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>

As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be invulnerable to root intrusion for approximately 100 years.</p>
