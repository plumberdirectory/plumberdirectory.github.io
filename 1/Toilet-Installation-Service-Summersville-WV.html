If your package only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint.

It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
