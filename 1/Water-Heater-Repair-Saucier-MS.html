<h3>What To Do First When I Need An Emergency Plumber Near Me Saucier MS</h3>
<p>The most effective method to resolve hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Domestic water that arrives to your Ohio house carries minerals that can cause rust on metal parts and components. To prevent deterioration from rust, storage tanks are geared up with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by attracting destructive materials. By having the anode rod checked routinely and changed as needed, you can double the life of your water heater.</p>
