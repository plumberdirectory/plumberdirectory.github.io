<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by getting rid of firmness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener alternative in locations where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently eliminate firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
