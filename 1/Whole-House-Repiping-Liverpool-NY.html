Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without warning, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to spot.</p>
