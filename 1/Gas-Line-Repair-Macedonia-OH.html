<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
