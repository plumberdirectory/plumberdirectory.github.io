<p>Water temperature level problems can be repaired by changing the temperature on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be caused by a blocked aerator screen.

<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades.

When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
