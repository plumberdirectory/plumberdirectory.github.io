<p>One common method for a home's water system to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which might become tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines.

Many of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really harmful if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the proper precautions.</p>
