An approved backflow prevention device, which should be checked yearly, should be installed on the service connection that the department has actually identified as having a capacity for backflow.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
