If you need a new toilet, the cost mostly depends upon the toilet you pick. Toilets differ in style, flushing efficiency and bowl shape, all of that make some toilets more costly than others. When setting up a brand-new toilet, the plumber may also need to make modifications to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the overall cost of the job.</p>
