For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more quickly.

While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>
