<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has typically been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due largely to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening just eliminates firmness minerals and eliminates problems that are a nuisance and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not need. However, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this decision a significant one.</p>

Detach waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen up screws on the electrical clamp port and get rid of wires from the waste disposal unit.</p>
