<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (typically 10 feet large) where main sewers traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
