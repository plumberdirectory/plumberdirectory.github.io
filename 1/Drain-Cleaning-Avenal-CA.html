A plumbing professional can identify whether the issue with your faucet is a fast fix or the outcome of other issues in your house's plumbing system. More complicated issues with water temperature or pressure may require replacing the hot water heater, which generally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capability and type.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to acquire this certification.
