<p>The program achieves its mission by providing for the adoption and promulgation of suitable guidelines and regulations for the construction of plumbing facilities where mandated. Cold showers? High energy bills? It might be time for a new warm water heater. However in order to reap the benefits of a brand-new energy-efficient device, you'll need to have it installed correctly.

<p>A rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, state, you need a brand-new burner set and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
