First, plans for each device to be set up need to be drawn up by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent out to the DEP, which may use up to 3 weeks or more to authorize and process. Turned down strategies must be modified and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can add another a number of weeks to the timeline.</p>

<p>If you see low water pressure or blemished water, it usually signifies rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals build up over time, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you might observe lower water pressure. The discoloration takes place when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and circulation into your supply of water, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or rust can become a health threat in your water.</p>

The majority of water looks alike - however inside a clear glass of water there countless dissolved minerals which are entirely invisible to your naked eye. One glass of tap water can have a high content of minerals - another glass of faucet water can have a low material of minerals.</p>
