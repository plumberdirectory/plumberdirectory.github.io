<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Barberton OH</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
