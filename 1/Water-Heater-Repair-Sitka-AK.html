<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to make sure that all plumbing set up throughout building and construction of a brand-new or renovated building is installed by knowledgeable craftsmen in accordance with applicable codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or pour flat soda in your sink, you typically understand your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain materializes through flooding, the clog is more than likely in the draining pipes fixture itself. Obstructions in a fixture can cause damaging damage to your draining pipes system the longer they continue.</p>
