Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
