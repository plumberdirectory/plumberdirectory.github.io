<p>Versus this, there is some anecdotal proof that specific magnetic and electromagnetic gadgets can be efficient in preventing scale development in tough water supply. It is very hard to judge such claims, which are nearly never based on tests that are well adequate described to permit others to assess them and to verify the results.
