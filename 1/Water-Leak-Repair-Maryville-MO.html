<p>Many property owners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to fix their clogged or dirty drain concerns. These chemicals are easy to utilize and inexpensive, but they harm your pipes and their results are only short term.

This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is constantly recommended.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
