<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing installed during building of a brand-new or refurbished structure is set up by experienced artisans in accordance with relevant codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains.
