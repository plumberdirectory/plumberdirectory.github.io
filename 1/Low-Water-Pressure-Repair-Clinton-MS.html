AVB's can be plastic or brass and either electric or manual. Unlike other backflow preventers, AVBs are set up on each zone of the irrigation system, immediately after the zone control valve.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
