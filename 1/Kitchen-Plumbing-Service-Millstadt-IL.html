<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent person. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as assured. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Tankless Water Heaters - supply hot water as needed without a tank. The activation of a faucet needing hot water triggers the heater and water is heated as it streams through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Cooking oil and other greases should never ever be put down the garbage disposal because they can hamper the blades. Finally, cold water needs to be running when the garbage disposal is on and should continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is turned off to make sure that all food particles have been washed through the pipes.</p>
