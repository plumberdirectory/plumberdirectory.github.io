<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair service technician knows the correct installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation.
