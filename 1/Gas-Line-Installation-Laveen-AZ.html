Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it might require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
<p>Examining the water, age, and condition lines to the water heater can assist plumbers comprehend lots of things, including water pressure and signs of leakages.
