<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, inspect to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
