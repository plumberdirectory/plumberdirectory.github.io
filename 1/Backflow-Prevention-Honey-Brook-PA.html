<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Honey Brook PA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>You hear water running or leaking in the tank. A backflow happens when water runs backwards through your pipes and into the drinking water system. The water flowing backwards from a cross-connection may contaminate the drinking water system. Yard watering systems, pool, and jacuzzis are common cross-connection points.
