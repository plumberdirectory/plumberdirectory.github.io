<p>It usually symbolizes rust and mineral buildup if you notice low water pressure or discolored water. As rust and minerals develop gradually, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you might observe lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can end up being a health hazard in your water.</p>
