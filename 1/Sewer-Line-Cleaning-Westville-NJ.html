<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). During this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the extremely focused saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank).
