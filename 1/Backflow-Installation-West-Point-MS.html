<p>No, you should NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about protecting your drain and plumbing system. The reason is that these chemical cleaners can be even more damaging than handy, potentially gnawing at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a house's entire plumbing system, consisting of both water supply and drain lines. Normally, a whole-house repipe deserves the financial investment in the long run due to the fact that it may attend to the root reason for the chronic plumbing problems in your home.</p>
<p>Furthermore, problems with the sink must also be dealt with immediately in order to avoid water damage and decomposing under the system. If your sink is broken, has sustained other damage, or has a broken drain basket, you might wish to forgo kitchen sink repair for a complete kitchen sink replacement.
