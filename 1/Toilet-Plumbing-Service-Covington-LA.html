<p>One typical way for a house's water supply to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which might end up being tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the issue might spread significantly. A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in individual houses, it likewise prevents wastewater in private houses from receding out and infecting the public supply of water.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
