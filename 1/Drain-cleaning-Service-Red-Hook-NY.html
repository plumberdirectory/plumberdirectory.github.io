<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a waste disposal unit can be found in two fundamental types - continuous feed, which normally has a wall-mounted switch so the unit keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which needs a food cover be in place to run the system. Constant feed prevails and the simplest to use; a batch feed design is much safer but can be slower to use on big quantities of food waste because you have to process it in batches.

<p>Leaks - Next, leakages represent the most common cause for kitchen sink repair. Normally, they start little and go unnoticed, and after time can lead to big puddles below your sink and cabinets.

If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Whether you have a garbage disposal and it's not working properly, or if it's lastly time to install one in your house, a garbage disposal is a previous high-end that is practically a requirement in these times. Always continue to run water throughout and after utilizing your disposal. Ideally, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has disappeared down the drain.</p>
