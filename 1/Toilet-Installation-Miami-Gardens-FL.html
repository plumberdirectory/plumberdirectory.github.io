<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Miami Gardens FL</h3>
<p>In water circulation systems, water is typically preserved at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may be or fail reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
