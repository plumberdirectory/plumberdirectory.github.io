<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
