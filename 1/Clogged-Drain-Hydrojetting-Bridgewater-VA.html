<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing procedure consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Storage tank water heaters are the most typical, and are run with gas. Their design consists of an insulated tank where water is heated up and kept until required.

Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will accumulate.</p>
