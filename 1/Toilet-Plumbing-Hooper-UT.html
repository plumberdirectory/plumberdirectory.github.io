<p>There are specific plumbers who concentrate on plumbing connected with house renovation and new building and construction. When a new home is constructed, water pipes need to be run, and toilets, faucets and sinks need to be set up correctly and to local, state, and federal code. While your go-to plumber may be a terrific candidate for unclogging your toilet, a more specific plumber must be used for house remodeling work.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. A lot of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very harmful if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the proper preventative measures.</p>
