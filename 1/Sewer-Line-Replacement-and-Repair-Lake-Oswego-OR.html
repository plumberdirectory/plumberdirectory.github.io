<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Lake Oswego OR</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow happens at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>

Backflow can occur in a variety of situations that may draw water from places such as garden fountains, swimming pools, or sprinkler system systems into City water system lines. Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing if it is linked to any outside water source. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or momentary connection between a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other compounds.
