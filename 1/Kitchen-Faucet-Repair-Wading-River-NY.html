<p>Aside from these 2 important components, there are a myriad of small, maybe less crucial things that can deteriorate or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more rapidly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to function at its best.</p>
