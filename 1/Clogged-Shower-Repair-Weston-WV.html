<p>Some pipe products are cheaper than others; some are more brittle and prone to breaking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other materials are susceptible to corrosion and rust while some are untouched. Particular pipe products have higher coefficients of heat pressure, making them more susceptible to structural tensions and strains as a result of temperature change and ice formation. And these differences dictate the possible need for backflow preventers.</p>
