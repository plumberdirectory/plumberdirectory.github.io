<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each component. If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of direct or consistent) of the element, which might trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
