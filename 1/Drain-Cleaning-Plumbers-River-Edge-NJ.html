<p>Sewer linings can help to repair cracked pipes without having to entirely replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Day to day use must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also occur if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the system in a safe and stable  place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't fall over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regeneration, you should wait until after the cycle is completed and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings. You should also examine to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>

This ensures that water within sprinkler systems, water pumps, and other watering and wastewater systems stays detached from clean" water.</p>
