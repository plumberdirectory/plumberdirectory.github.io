<p>The secret to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there need to be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you should probably not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop obstructing is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>

<p>Depending on what part of the world you're from you may have heard sink disposals referred to as garbage disposals," food waste disposers," or, if you're actually proper, a sink waste disposal system." Whatever you call it, switching one out or installing a brand-new one is a relatively easy task. The work on private mains normally takes one to two weeks, and service work normally takes an additional one to two weeks, though some might be carried out simultaneously on a task. However, the gas to your home will just need to be switched off for a short time period (generally less than 4 hours).</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
