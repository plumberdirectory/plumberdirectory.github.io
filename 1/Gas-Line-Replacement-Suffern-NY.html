<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have really tight tolerances that have to be kept. A crucial thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each element. If the component is not fixed appropriately, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than stable or direct) of the part, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities.

For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
