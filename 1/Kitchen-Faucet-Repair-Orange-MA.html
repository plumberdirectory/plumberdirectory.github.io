Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Much of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely hazardous if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make sure to take the proper precautions if using one of these items.</p>
