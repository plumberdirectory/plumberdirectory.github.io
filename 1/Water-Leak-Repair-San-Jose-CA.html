<p>Natural gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running home appliances such as hot water heater. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or overload gas. Methane is a naturally taking place gas that takes place in the earth's crust and is likewise in some cases formed by the decomposing of organic matters like sewage or manure. As beneficial as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a quiet killer.
