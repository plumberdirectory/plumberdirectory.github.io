<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
