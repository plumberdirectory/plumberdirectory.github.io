<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not unusual, however if your toilet is blocking more than 3 times a month, there's a bigger problem to take a look at. If your toilet is fairly brand-new, you might need to switch toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a clog from the drain. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing firm where you can look up your state's licensing information. Inspect the list of state licensing agencies to learn whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also keeps a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>

And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for up to two hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
