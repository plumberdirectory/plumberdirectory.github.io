<p>Backpressure may take place when the potable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Potable and non-potable water or liquids can be required into the drinkable supply system if these connections are not properly secured.</p>
<p>Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which triggers the solidity ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 need to be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down. When it comes to pipe repair, the most pricey aspects aren't the machinery or products utilized, but the yard, landscaping and uprooting damage that ensues.</p>
