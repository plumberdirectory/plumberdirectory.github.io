It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an appropriately operating RPZ assembly to regularly discharge percentages of water.

Appropriate drainage needs to also be supplied.</p>
