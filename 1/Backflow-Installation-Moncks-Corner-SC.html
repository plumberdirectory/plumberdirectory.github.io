<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to detect.</p>
