<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without obstructing.</p>
