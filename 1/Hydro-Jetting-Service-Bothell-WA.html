Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be warmed and readily available for use. Also, deterioration of the tank's elements can trigger the tank to have a brief life. If the water heater is old or you see obvious indications of rust, demand that a new one be set up.</p>
