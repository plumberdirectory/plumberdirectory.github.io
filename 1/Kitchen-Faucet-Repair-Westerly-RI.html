Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
