Mineral deposits can decide on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be warmed and offered for use. Likewise, corrosion of the tank's elements can trigger the tank to have a short life. Request that a brand-new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see apparent signs of rust.</p>
