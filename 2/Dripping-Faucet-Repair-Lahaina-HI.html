<p>106.2.2.3 Repairs to Gas Piping. Repairs to gas piping will not be exempt work and will need an authorization and inspection. Some units run from a lightswitch, while others use a push button switch installed 1 close by. They cost approximately $100 for the whole system, and can be installed 1 on the counter, sink, or cabinet for convenience. Hydro-jets: Having your drains hydro jetted can be a valuable tool in keeping trouble drains under control. When a regular cable television can't, Hydro jets project a high powered stream of water to clean the lining of pipes.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove particles such as difficult water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
