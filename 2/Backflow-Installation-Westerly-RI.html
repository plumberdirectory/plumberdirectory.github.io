<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is typically made from aluminum or magnesium and stays as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can attract the irons that would usually trigger rust. After extended use, these rods will ultimately become worn and need to be replaced. If you do not replace them, you could experience major problems with your water heater really rapidly, not to mention finding that reddish-brown color in your water</p>
<p>Often triggered by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then examine and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This indicates a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is normally the fix. Alternatively, in some cases a malfunctioning fill valve may actuate intermittently, as well. Water will not drain or is draining slowly through the disposal.</p>
