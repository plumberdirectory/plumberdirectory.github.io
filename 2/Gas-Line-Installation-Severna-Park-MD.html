<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely concentrated service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the salt water tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank.
