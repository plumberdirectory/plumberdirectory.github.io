<h3>Everything You Need To Know About A Blocked Drain in Supply NC 28462</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
