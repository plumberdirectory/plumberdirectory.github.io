<p>Before our professional service technicians can start applying their abilities and experience, we initially need to guarantee that the line is appropriately cleaned and gotten ready for our repair. Our repair processes rely on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, imperfections caused by waste buildup can prevent the liner from adhering to the walls properly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits an extensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The unique nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to enable the water to cover the entire diameter of the sewer line and offer a careful cleaning.</p>
