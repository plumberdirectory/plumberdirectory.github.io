<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is a very crucial part of the style of each part. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of consistent or direct) of the element, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities.
