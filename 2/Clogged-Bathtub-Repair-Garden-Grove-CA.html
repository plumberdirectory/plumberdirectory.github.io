Water softeners normally use salt (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are supplied from dissolved salt chloride salt, likewise called salt water.

Houses built in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, people had no concept that the lead in the pipes could seep into the drinking water, let alone the health risks related to lead.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately begins. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regrowth generally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
