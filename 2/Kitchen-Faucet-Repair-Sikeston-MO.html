<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water system line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings contaminants back to the primary supply of water system, making the water in it hazardous to drink.</p>
