<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Plano IL 60545</h3>
<p>If you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has actually begun to leak, first consider your alternatives. A complete sewer pipe replacement might not be essential. Often, relining your existing pipes is a much better alternative. If your sewer lines are underneath trees, near substantial landscaping, sidewalks, driveways or other semi-permanent functions, overall sewer excavation can cause a lot of collateral damage (and expenditure) to the surrounding area.</p>

Cooking Grease: Cooking grease need to never be tossed down the kitchen drain. While it may go down as a liquid, as it cools it can end up being solid, coating your pipes while doing so. It still stays sticky, however, which permits it to attract other particles, eventually producing a massive blockage in your pipes.</p>

A high-efficiency toilet with extra functions can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're changing an existing toilet, add $ 30 to $50 to eliminate your old toilet.</p>
