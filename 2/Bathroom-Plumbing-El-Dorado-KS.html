<p>A cross-connection is any temporary or irreversible connection in between a public water system or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system including nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping in between a public water system or customer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
