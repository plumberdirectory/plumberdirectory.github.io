<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the right length for your brand-new disposal. If it's too long, simply link it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation.

To avoid this, make certain the new waste disposal unit installation kit includes a tube, or purchase one individually at the same time for about $3.</p>
