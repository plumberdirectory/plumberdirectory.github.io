<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature is kept at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water streams immediately from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In circumstances where there is a need to provide sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small packing dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high threat protection assembly.</p>
