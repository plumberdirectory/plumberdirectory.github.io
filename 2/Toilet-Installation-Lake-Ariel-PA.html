<p>When you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve, check the washer for wear or fractures. Changing a bad washer is easy and inexpensive. But finding the ideal washer might not be. The most typical washers are frequently offered in your home centers and hardware stores. Other designs can be tough to find. If you choose to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the shop to discover a match. Plumbers usually replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
