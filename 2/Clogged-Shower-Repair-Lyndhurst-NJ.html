<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest much more. With this approach, you know the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>

Frequently the business owner, a master plumber is subject to inspection and must make certain all journeyman plumbers working for his/her company are in compliance with plumbing policies.</p>
