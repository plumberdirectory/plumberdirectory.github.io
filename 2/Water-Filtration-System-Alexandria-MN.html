<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a service of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We recommend organic products, such as Bio-Clean, because they work better than products including harsh chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>New shower drains develop strong seals that are less most likely to loosen over time. A number of alternatives are excellent for tight areas and enable fast installation. If you have a historic house, we can find a drain that will look excellent with your existing design.
