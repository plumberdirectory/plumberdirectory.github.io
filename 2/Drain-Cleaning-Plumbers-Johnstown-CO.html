<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements may have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each component. If the part is not repaired properly, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or steady) of the component, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities.

For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
