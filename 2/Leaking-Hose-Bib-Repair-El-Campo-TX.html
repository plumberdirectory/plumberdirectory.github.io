<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and intricate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can trigger deterioration that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Noise-- Gradually sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and takes away from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
