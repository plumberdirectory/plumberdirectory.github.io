<p>Changing your sink is a detailed process. Procedure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be used. Though it might require additional adapters, versatile tubing is far much easier to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Check spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>
