You have actually probably seen drain cleaner items on the racks at your local home improvement shop, so when your drain gets clogged or isn't draining water like it should, you may be lured to head down there and select some as much as fix it by yourself.

<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair professional understands the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
