<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and inspect the flange and drain for leakages. Backflow - Do you see water coming back in your sink or shower?
