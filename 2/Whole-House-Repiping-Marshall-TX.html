<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks in Marshall TX 75670?</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
