Sanford & Boy plumbing supplies sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas.

<p>Recent advances in toilet innovation have actually made modern restrooms even more comfortable and practical. If your toilet was made prior to 1994, then it's most likely costing you money every day. New toilets utilize almost two gallons less per flush while offering the same or much better flushing power as their out-of-date counterparts.

The salt water tank holds an extremely focused option of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank runs out of salt, the water going through the unit will no longer be softened.</p>
