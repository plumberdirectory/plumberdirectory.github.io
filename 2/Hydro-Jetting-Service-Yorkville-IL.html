<p>If you've constantly lived in an area with difficult water, you may not recognize how much it impacts you-- however if you've recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from hard water. Difficult water interferes with the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, causing you to use more. Hard water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp.

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer lowers water service pressure to the structure; additional, more significant expenses can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for locals.
