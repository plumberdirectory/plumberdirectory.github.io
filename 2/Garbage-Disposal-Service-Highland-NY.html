<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of small, possibly less important things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more quickly.

If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom.
