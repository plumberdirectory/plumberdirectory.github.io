Which is why choosing a comfortable, reliable toilet seat is extremely important. Nevertheless, you need to make certain your toilet seat actually fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are standard sized - indicating a "will fit" seat is sufficient for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have distinctively formed bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It actually isn't a great concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have actually been specifically created to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to move around, or won't disperse your weight uniformly and might ultimately cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
