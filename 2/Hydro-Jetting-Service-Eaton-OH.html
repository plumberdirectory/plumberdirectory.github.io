<p>There are two kinds of materials utilized to develop a garbage disposal system: aluminum and stainless steel. The average cost of an aluminum garbage disposal ranges from $60 to $150, while a stainless steel garbage disposal has a typical cost of just over $150. Sewer pipes can be notoriously tough to trace, especially on older homes, so you'll want to work with someone who will trace the problem at its origin.</p>

Some types of pipes can rust gradually. This rust will break off into your home's water supply and can turn your tap water a reddish or brown  color. In this case, repiping your home is necessary since not only are your pipes old, but your water quality is affected as well.</p>
