<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic man. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as guaranteed. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The total you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>However, you also need to think about the age of your system. If your system is getting near to 10 years old, it's usually not smart to pay for repairs if they are worth more than 50 percent of the price of a new unit. If problems become more frequent with an older system, then it is encouraged that you have the garbage disposal changed. We offer a variety of highly effective and affordable systems, and supply in advance pricing before work starts so there are not a surprises.

<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
