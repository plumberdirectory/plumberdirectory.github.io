<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese.

Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
