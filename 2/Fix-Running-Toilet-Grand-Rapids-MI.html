<h3>Why Plumbers Are So Expensive Grand Rapids MI</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I chose this company because they had excellent reviews and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it too.</p>
<p>This is always the # 1 top priority for any legitimate professional. Plumbing can be an unsafe task, and can adversely affect everybody living in the house when completed inadequately. There is particularly no exception for dealing with toilets.
