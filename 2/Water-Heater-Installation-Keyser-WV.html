<p>Gas leaks are commonly found at the gas valve, flare fitting, or at the gas union-a piece that enables connections and disconnections of gas devices. If you use liquid dish soap to the suspected area, a fast way to identify a gas leak is. If it bubbles, you likely have a gas leak and must instantly call a gas plumber to carry out an emergency gas line repair.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another approach is to introduce a chemical compound that acts as a chelating agent. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water instead of building up on surface areas. However, if they stay in one location for long, as they may in a water heater, the buildup could still happen.</p>
