For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part requires to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
