This innovation is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

<p>These guys were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had fantastic evaluations and a fair price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task cleaning up after it too.</p>
