<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

Sometimes drain repair requirements can be solved reasonably quickly by an experienced handyman. At other times, however, portions of a drain may need to be disassembled, analyzed, and cleared prior to being replaced. In many cases, a handyman may figure out that a replacement part is necessary (like a pvc, reducer, or tailpiece trap) to ensure normal operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman representative today to go over repair choices.</p>
