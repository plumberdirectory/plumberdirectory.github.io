<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and expensive plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a difficult job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
