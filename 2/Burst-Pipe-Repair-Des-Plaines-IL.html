Trenchless pipe repair is a form of pipe repair that does not include any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair likewise referred to as trenchless pipe lining is a long lasting and exceptional alternative for your broken pipes. The pipe lining procedure involves our group saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. When the felt liner is totally filled, it is pressed through your pipeline. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all fractures and flaws. The liner is left to harden in place for a number of hours or 60 minutes if heat is used. When the process is complete, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be examined one more time to make certain your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
