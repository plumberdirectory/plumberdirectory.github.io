<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair specialist knows the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation.
