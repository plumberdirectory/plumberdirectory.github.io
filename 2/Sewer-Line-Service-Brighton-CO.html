<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Brighton CO</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is usually maintained at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might be or stop working lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
