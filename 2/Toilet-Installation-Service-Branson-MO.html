<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Look for leakages under the sink to validate that your plumber's putty is making a good seal. Eliminate the drain stopper, and enable the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Check for leaks and tighten up as needed. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cords as wanted.</p>
