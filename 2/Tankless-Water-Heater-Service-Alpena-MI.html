An RP on a public or community pool should be checked upon installation and after that every year.</p>
<p>Today's high-efficiency softeners are changing the economics of water softening in the carwash market. Typically, the savings have been based mostly on decreasing chemical and cleaning agent costs. While those savings are still considerable, new commercial softening technology using multi-tank systems (MTS) also uses significant water and salt cost savings.</p>
