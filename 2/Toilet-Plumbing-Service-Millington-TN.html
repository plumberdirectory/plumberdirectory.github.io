<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process.

Each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
