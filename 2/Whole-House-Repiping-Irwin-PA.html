<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this method, you know the turnkey cost entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
