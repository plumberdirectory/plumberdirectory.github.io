<h3>Drain Cleaning Service in Walla Walla Washington</h2>
<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
