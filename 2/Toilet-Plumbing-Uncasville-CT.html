<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Uncasville CT</h3>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
