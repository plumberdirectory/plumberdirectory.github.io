<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies East Brunswick NJ</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure requires a backflow preventer or several gadgets, or if you get approved for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in very unusual cases where the building is deemed to not position a risk to the supply of water, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
<p>Strainers are recommended prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire combating water lines.
