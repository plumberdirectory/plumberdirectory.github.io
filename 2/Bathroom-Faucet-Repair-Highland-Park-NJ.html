The typical cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For multiple installs, expenses range from $33 to $89 per drip leg.

<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are seriously harmed, for changing an entire pipe system, or for fixing bigger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and attracting a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be invulnerable to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
