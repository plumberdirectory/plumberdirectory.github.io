<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this large quantity of trash does not need to go in the garbage can. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without impeding water flow. By installing a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by saving the amount of trash that gets sent out to garbage dumps and other dumping areas. With a waste disposal unit the trash is managed through currently existing water facilities.</p>
