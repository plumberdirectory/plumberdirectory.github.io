For instance, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any actual or possible connection in between the general public water supply and a source of contamination or pollution) can permit impurities or pollutants to go into the safe and clean water supply. Sickness can arise from consuming water that has been infected due to backflow.</p>
