<p>As soon as the elements are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback turned off stays in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air must be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from important areas in the assembly.

Comparing the test arises from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flow chart is essential to guarantee it was fixed effectively. An effectively repaired assembly needs to offer years of defense.</p>
