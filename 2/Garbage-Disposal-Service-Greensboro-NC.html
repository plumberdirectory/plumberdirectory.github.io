<h2>Tips To Hire Emergency Plumbing Companies in Greensboro</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your residential or commercial property. The camera is manually manipulated on a flexible rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light provides a clear image for the technician to properly take a look at conditions and diagnose the performance of the pipes. The information we obtain from the inspection allows us to make an informed choice regarding the condition of your pipes and recommend the very best service also. If the pipe requires to be cleaned of clogs or relined with epoxy resin, we can make the ideal recommendation with self-confidence.</p>
