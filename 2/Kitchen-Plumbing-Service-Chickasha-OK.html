Backflow Preventer meaning: A device that enables water to go through it in one direction, but prevents it from going backwards in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at an affordable amount, there should be no concern in getting most of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you must most likely not take into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another tip to stop clogging is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are finished cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>
