<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to find the cause of routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are created to supply decades of protection. There are many regional conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water quality, turbidity or temperature can all trigger the assembly to deteriorate in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies may hardly ever need repair while some are repaired on a regular basis. The test information from the field test will identify the repair frequency.</p>
