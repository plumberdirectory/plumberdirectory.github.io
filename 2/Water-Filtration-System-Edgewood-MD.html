It is essential to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt a properly functioning RPZ assembly to regularly release percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in areas subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage must also be offered.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are developed to supply years of security. There are many regional conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water temperature, quality or turbidity can all trigger the assembly to deteriorate in its performance. Some backflow prevention assemblies might hardly ever need repair while some are repaired on a regular basis. The test data from the field test will identify the repair frequency.</p>
