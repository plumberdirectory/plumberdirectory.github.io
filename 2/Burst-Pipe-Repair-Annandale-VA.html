<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you pour down there won't go through.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Repair Procedures in Annandale VA 22003</h3>
<p>Here's what to expect on the day of your water heater installation appointment. Installing natural gas lines can bring a new level of service. As tough water goes through the mineral tank, the beads inside attract the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause tough water stick to the beads, and the treated water goes out into your house's plumbing system.</p>
<p>New shower drains create strong seals that are less likely to loosen over time. Numerous options are excellent for tight areas and enable quick installation. If you have a historic house, we can discover a drain that will look great with your existing d√©cor. Measure the height of your old hot water heater and purchase a new one the same height so you don't need to change the length of the water, gas or electrical lines.</p>
<p>If you have an older house, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to corrode. This corrosion can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have numerous negative results on your health. Rusty pipes also lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water system line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unfavorable flow of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries impurities back to the primary water system system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
