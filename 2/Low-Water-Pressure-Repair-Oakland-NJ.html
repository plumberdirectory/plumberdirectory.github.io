<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Oakland NJ</h3>
<p>These guys were amazing! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had great evaluations and a reasonable cost, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task tidying up after it too.</p>
