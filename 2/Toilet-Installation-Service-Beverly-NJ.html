Angie's List members who had brand-new disposals installed in 2013 reported an average cost of about $230, with a range from about $210 to $255, not counting discounts some providers use members.

<p>Lots of house owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their clogged or unclean drain problems. These chemicals are simple to utilize and affordable, but they damage your pipes and their results are just short-term.
