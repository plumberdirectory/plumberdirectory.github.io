<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a basic contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered up; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the indications of quality work that you might miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in studs, floors, and joists. Lastly, a quality contractor will not danger working with a substandard plumber. An easy mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and make complex the job with insurance claims, wasted time, and claims. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the very best.</p>
