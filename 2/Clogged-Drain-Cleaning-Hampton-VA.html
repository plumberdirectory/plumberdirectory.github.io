<p>Leaking gas can cause asphyxiation and unsafe explosions. Fortunately, commercial gasses, such as the kind a gas stove or heater uses, have a strong odor added to them so that leakages can be more easily detected by house owners.

It takes between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, disconnect and remove your old hot water heater. Placing the new system takes approximately thirty minutes, and it takes another 45 to 60 minutes to secure the new connection points and validate that all functions are up to code.</p>
