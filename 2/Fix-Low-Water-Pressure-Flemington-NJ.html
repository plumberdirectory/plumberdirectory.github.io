Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely focused saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
