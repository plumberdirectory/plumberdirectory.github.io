<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>This is always the # 1 concern for any legitimate professional. Plumbing can be a hazardous job, and can adversely affect everyone living in the house when finished inadequately.
