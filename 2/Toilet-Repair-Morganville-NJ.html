<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company because they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it also.</p>
