This is due mostly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening simply gets rid of hardness minerals and removes problems that are a problem and not a hazard to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers individual choice not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
