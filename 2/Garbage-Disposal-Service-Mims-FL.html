The clearing of stoppages in component branches; the fixing of incidental leaks in components, pipes or valves; or the elimination and reinstallation of existing or brand-new plumbing components, residential type plumbing appliances, non-testable backflow devices, and plumbing appurtenances; supplied that such repairs do not need the replacement or include of concealed piping, or the rearrangement of valves, pipes or components.</p>
<p>Drain blockages in bathroom sinks can happen gradually from the accumulation of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that accumulates within pipes. As a clog ends up being larger over time, it blocks the pipe, stopping water from draining pipes appropriately.

<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
