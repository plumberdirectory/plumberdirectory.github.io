<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the perpetrator. But not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
<p>The Delaware Division of Public Health Plumbing Permit and Inspection Program has workplaces in Kent and Sussex Counties. For instance, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can trigger pipes to lose pressure. When that occurs, water is no longer pressed forward into the residential or commercial property, enabling it to flow backward into city water supplies.</p>
<p>We focus on repair, service and installation of all makes and models of gas hot water heater, electrical water heaters and tankless hot water heater. Carefully flex the float arm to put extra pressure on the toilet valve. (To change a float that does not have an arm, see Photo 8.) Then flush the toilet to see if it works. Running toilets can be the outcome of a rusty overflow pipe, broken flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve. Offer the specialists at Wingate a call to repair your running toilet and minimize wasted water.</p>
