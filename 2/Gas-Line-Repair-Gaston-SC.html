<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of preserving the stability and effectiveness of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you discover unusual popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your unit, this might be an indication that sediment has developed in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating element. Lacking warm water rapidly is another sign of sediment accumulation, because the sediment is using up more area in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
