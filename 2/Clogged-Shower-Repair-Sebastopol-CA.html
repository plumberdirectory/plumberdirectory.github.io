<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
