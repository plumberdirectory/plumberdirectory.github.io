<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
