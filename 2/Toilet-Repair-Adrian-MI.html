<p>E.R. Services understands the value of maintaining the stability and efficiency of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you notice strange popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your unit, this could be a sign that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating aspect.
