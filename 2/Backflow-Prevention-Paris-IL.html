Some elements might have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the part. The guide is a really critical part of the style of each element. If the element is not repaired properly, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or constant) of the part, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities.
