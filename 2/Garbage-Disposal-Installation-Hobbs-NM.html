When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely focused saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank).
