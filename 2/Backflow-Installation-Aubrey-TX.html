<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with house owners in the area. He noted that there are certain pollutants that citizens are handling and an RO can help alleviate those issues. Due to being largely farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of farming waste.

When a brand-new house is developed, pipes need to be run, and toilets, faucets and sinks need to be installed properly and to local, state, and federal code.

<p>Clear the trap: If the above methods do not work, the next action would be to remove the P-trap under the sink. Place a container beneath the area to capture water then loosen the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in location. Nowadays, a lot of kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
