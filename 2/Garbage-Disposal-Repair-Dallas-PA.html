<p>Aside from these two important parts, there are a myriad of little, possibly less important things that can deteriorate or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away much more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
