<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
