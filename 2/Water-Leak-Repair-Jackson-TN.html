<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you don't get that chance. In addition, your contractor knows the dead giveaways of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in studs, floors, and joists. Lastly, a quality contractor will not risk working with an inferior plumber. An easy mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floors and complicate the task with insurance claims, wasted time, and claims.
