<p>Bear in mind that repiping a house is a major plumbing repair, and you need to just work with a trusted and well-respected contractor like Cabrillo in order to make sure that the task is done right. The average cost to install a drip leg is $75 to $150, which is a plumber's minimum charge. For several installs, expenses vary from $33 to $89 per drip leg. Drip legs catch moisture so that it does not enter the control unit. Although small pieces of sediment may survive a drip leg.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you believe a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually changed color. If it has, you most likely have a leak.</p>
