<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and associated devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to spot.</p>
