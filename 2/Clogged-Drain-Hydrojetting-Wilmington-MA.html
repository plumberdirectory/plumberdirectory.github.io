<p>The best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's concealed; you do not get that chance.

Finally, a quality contractor will not threat working with an inferior plumber. An easy error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and complicate the job with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and claims. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the best.</p>
