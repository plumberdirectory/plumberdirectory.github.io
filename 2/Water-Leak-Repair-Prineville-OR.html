<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Prineville OR</h3>
<p>To determine if your house is a poly house," start with the outside. Underground water mains are generally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it enters the house near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is attached to the end of the water main. Make sure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe enters the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Was your home built prior to the 1970s and has not gone through remodeling or pipe replacement? It is likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another material which has corroded and decomposed over the years if so. Older pipes can trigger major leakages and even contaminate your water as they decay. Even the greatest quality pipes will not last permanently and will need to be changed.</p>
