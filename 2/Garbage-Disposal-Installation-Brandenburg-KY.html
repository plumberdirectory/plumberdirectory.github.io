The salt water tank holds an extremely concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand contributed to the salt water tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
