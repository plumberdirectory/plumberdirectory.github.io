<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each part. If the element is not repaired properly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than consistent or direct) of the element, which could cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
