Which is why choosing a comfy, well-made toilet seat is very important. Nevertheless, you have to ensure your toilet seat in fact fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are basic sized - indicating a "will fit" seat suffices for security and convenience. Some toilets, however, have uniquely formed bowls and need a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It truly isn't a great idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have actually been specifically developed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to move around, or won't disperse your weight equally and might ultimately trigger fractures in the bowl.</p>
