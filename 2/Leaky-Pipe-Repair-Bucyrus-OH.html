<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this method, you understand the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indication the tank is failing and will need to be changed. Schedule an estimate as quickly as possible and guarantee nothing is near the heater that could be possibly harmed if it is in a garage and a small sluggish leak. Leaking water heaters can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
