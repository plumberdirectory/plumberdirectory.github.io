<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible amount, there should be no issue in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food items you must most likely not take into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>

<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our ranges, and for running home appliances such as hot water heater. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally taking place gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is also in some cases formed by the decaying of organic matters like sewage or manure. As beneficial as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. Nevertheless, to thwart off that danger, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which provides it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking.
