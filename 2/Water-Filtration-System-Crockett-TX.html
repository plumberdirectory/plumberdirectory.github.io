Exemptions, which are granted in incredibly uncommon cases where the structure is considered to not present a risk to the water supply, should be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
