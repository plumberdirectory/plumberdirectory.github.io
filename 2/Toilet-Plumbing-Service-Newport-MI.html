<p>Camera are among the most important tools in the plumbing company. When looking for a new flapper, your best alternative is to try and discover the same flapper that originally included your existing flush valve.

I 'd enjoy to post some photos of this. Simply look on line. The problem does exist.</p>

Blanc also built a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big industrial and municipal sewer pipes.
