<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Plumbing is a crucial part of your house or company, and its ability to function is necessary. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains clogging, this might be an indication of a larger issue, like a tree root invasion or a large clog. If the drains clog occasionally but you can typically flush them out, this may be a smaller clog like an accumulation of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap residue from the bathroom. Small obstructions can become huge ones relatively quickly.</p>
