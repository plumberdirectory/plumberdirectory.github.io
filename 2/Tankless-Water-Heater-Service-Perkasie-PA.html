<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Perkasie PA</h3>
<p>The most efficient method to attend to tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
