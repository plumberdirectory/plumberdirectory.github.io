These products gather in the drain and ultimately harden versus the pipe walls, making them hard to remove. Your hot water heater is leaking: Water heater leaks are among the most common signs that your unit is at completion of its life-span, specifically if they are causing significant flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>
