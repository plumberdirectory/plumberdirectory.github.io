<h3>Useful Tips for Water Heater Repair in East Lansing MI 48823</h3>
<p>When you have sewer or water line problems, plumbers are the individuals to call. These lines are susceptible to damage or compromised function because of particles that cleans in or penetration by tree roots. The reality that these lines are sometimes buried can make it difficult to understand what the problem is. As your local Merriam plumbing pros, we are your go-to service for kitchen plumbing problems. No matter the concern, you can rely on our personnel to offer quality services with affordable rates.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the perpetrator. However not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>Typically, the cost to replace a toilet varies between $ 122 and $228, with the majority of property owners spending around $ 150 to $180. This does not include the price of the toilet, which averages $ 99 to $199, for an overall toilet replacement cost of $ 221 to $427. A high-efficiency toilet with extra features can cost $ 800 to $1,500 to install. The average installation takes a plumber 2 to 4 hours at $ 65 per hour. If you're changing an existing toilet, add $ 30 to $50 to remove your old toilet.</p>
<p>If you have actually ever been annoyed by cloudy white areas on your meals that will not go away, white shirts that turn dull and gray after a couple of washes, or a persistent layer of soap scum in your shower, you'll more than happy to know that water softening can get rid of these problems and more. Hard water triggers these concerns due to the minerals in the water that are left after a wash. With softened water, you won't need to fret about any concerns with mineral deposits sticking around. This makes tasks easier and less frustrating for everybody involved.</p>
