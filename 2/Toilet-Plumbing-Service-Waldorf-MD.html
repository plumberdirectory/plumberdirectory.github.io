<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
