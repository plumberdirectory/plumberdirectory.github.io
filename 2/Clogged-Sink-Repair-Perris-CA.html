Water pressure may stop working or be reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might enable infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
