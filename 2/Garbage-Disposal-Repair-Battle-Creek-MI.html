<p>When looking for a gas line installation in Dallas, for that reason, you need to use well-trained and certified experts for all aspects of your plumbing and gas line installation. As soon as your plumber has installed a gas line, you'll want an audit of the plumbing and installation to ensure that there are no gas leaks. This should be done before the plumber leaves the job. The audit will reduce the possibilities of a gas leak. Shut off the gas valves immediately if you do notice a pungent smell in your house after your plumber leaves.
