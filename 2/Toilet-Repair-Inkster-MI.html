<p>When you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve, examine the washer for wear or cracks. Replacing a bad washer is cheap and simple. But discovering the best washer may not be. The most typical washers are often offered in the house centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be difficult to discover. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the shop to find a match. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the perpetrator. However not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.
