<h3>High Pressure Hydro-Jetting in Maryland Heights Missouri</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Whether a water system is identified "soft" or "difficult" is dependent on the presence of 2 highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health perspective, these minerals have no negative results and are, in fact, vital daily nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the refreshing flavor many people discover preferable. However, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, perhaps plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the effectiveness of soaps and cleaning agents. At this moment the water is said to be difficult.</p>
