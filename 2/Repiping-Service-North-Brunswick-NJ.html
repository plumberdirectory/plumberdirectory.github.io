<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in North Brunswick NJ 08902?</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
