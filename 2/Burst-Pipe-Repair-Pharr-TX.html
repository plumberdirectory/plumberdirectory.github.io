<h3>Need An Emergency Plumber Pharr TX</h3>
<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
