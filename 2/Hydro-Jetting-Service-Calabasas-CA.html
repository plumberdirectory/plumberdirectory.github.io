<p>If you have an older home, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This corrosion can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable effects on your health. Rusty pipes also result in poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
