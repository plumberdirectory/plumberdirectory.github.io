<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or possible cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be needed on the water service line, within the structure, or in both locations. The backflow preventer you select should be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Authorized Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not presently noted should have been listed at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair specialist understands the right installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
