<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Staunton VA</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had excellent reviews and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task tidying up after it as well.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning experts are called into a home is because there is excessive hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are pretty cheap and simple to install, so there's no reason not to. When grease strengthens it sticks to the pipe and avoids water flow, eventually causing a backup. This added with other particles in your drain can cause a major backup.</p>
