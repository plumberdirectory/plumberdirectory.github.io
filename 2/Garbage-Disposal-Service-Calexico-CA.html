<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to discover the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or buying an older home.</p>

<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy, a guideline of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a brand-new burner package and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the home appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
