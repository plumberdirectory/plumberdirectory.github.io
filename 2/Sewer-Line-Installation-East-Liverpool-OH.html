<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it also.</p>
