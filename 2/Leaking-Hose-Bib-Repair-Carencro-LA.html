<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with property owners in the area. He kept in mind that there are particular pollutants that citizens are dealing with and an RO can help minimize those concerns. Due to being mainly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some house owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are a product of farming waste. Rinckey noted that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally happens in some soils and that too can be remedied with the ideal RO system.</p>
