<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a viable service, particularly when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are numerous downsides to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they usually consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>
