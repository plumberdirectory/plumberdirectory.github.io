<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the level of the rot.

Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
