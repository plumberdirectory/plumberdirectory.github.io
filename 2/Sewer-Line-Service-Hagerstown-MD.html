The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
