<p>Once the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>
