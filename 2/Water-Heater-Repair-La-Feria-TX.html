Declined plans need to be revised and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can add another several weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>Typically, problems with plumbing will be misdiagnosed by inexperienced or less thorough plumbers.

The specialist plumbers at Royal Class Service are here to clean your drains and take care of your home.</p>
