<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a blockage or can cause deterioration that blocks the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Noise-- Gradually sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and takes away from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
