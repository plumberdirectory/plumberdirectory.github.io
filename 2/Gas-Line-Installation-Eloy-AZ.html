He kept in mind that there are certain contaminants that citizens are handling and an RO can help relieve those problems. Due to being mostly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are installing ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste. Rinckey noted that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic likewise naturally happens in some soils and that too can be treated with the right RO system.</p>

So, if you are not looking specifically for a various disposal this might be something to consider.
