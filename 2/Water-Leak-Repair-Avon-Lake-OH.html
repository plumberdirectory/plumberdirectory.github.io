<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly focused option of salt (or sometimes potassium) to restore the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water service is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the salt water tank lacks salt, the water going through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
