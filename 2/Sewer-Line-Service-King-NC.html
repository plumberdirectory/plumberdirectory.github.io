<p>If you've constantly resided in an area with hard water, you may not recognize just how much it impacts you-- but if you've recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too familiar with the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from difficult water. Hard water interferes with the lathering of shampoos and soaps, triggering you to utilize more. Tough water also makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red frequently.</p>
