<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
