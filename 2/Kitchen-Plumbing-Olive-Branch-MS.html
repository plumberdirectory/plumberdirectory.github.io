<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Today, most professionals advise a mindful inspection of residential water heaters regularly - a minimum of yearly. Malfunctioning water heaters trigger a range of problems. These concerns run the range from undependable or sluggish water heating to expensive water leakages and possible fire dangers.
