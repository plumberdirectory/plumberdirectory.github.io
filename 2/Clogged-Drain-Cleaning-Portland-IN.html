<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
