<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
