<h3>How To Keep Bathroom Sinks Running Smoothly in Hawkinsville GA 31036</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
