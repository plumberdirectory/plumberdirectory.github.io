<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and then go back to service.

Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, normally regenerate after a lot of gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a rising and falling water utilize schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
