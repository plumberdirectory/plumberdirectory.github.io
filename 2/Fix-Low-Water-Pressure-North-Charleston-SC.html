<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is an incredibly pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of flow of water which may bring unclean water or other, hazardous substances into the public water system and personal plumbing. Backflow can happen in a number of situations that may draw water from locations such as garden water fountains, pool, or lawn sprinkler systems into City water supply lines. If it is linked to any outside water source, Backflow can likewise carry water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>

These chemicals are simple to use and economical, however they damage your pipes and their effects are only short term.

This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always advised.</p>
