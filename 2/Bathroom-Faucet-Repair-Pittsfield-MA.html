<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when looking for a practical option, especially when basic plunging does not seem to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they usually consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life.
