The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater service (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

<p>If you have an older house, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This deterioration can cause a buildup of lead, which can have numerous unfavorable impacts on your health. Rusty pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above approaches do not work, the next action would be to remove the P-trap under the sink. Place a container beneath the area to capture water then loosen the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in location. Nowadays, most kitchen drains are made from white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
