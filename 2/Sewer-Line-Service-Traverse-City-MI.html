<p>Gas leakages are commonly found at the gas valve, flare fitting, or at the gas union-a piece that allows connections and disconnections of gas home appliances.

<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not unusual, however if your toilet is blocking more than three times a month, there's a bigger problem to examine. If your toilet is relatively new, you may need to switch toilet paper or employ a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain. The National Contractor License Service keeps a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can search for your state's licensing info. Examine the list of state licensing companies to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise maintains a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>

Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
