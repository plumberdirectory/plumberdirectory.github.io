It is extremely challenging to evaluate such claims, which are almost never ever based upon tests that are well enough described to permit others to evaluate them and to confirm the outcomes. While the absence of "scientific" evidence does not in itself invalidate a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it should make one think twice to accept it without some assurance of efficiency.</p>
<p>6. Install the brand-new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, referred to as P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your home. Plumbers can fix or replace blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them working correctly. Leaking pipes can affect your indoor air quality.
