<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

The backflow prevention assembly should be dismantled and parts replaced with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be checked once again to be sure it was correctly repaired. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flow diagram is essential to guarantee it was fixed appropriately.
