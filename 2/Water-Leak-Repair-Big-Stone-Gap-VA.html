The unit chosen for an offered installation must be suitable for the system style and website conditions, including consideration of whether back siphoning or backpressure is most likely to take place. Even more, it should be installed in accordance with plumbing codes, maker requirements, and engineering standards for the type of system to be utilized.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
