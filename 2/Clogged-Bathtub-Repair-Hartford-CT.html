<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure.

<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Hartford CT</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
