<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An important thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is a really vital part of the design of each part. If the element is not repaired correctly, the guide could limit the motion (instead of consistent or direct) of the element, which could cause the part to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
