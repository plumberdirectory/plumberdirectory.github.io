As tough water passes through the mineral tank, the beads inside bring in the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that cause difficult water stay with the beads, and the treated water goes out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Crystallization: Reduced to TAC, this approach uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where firmness mineral ions are changed into a stable crystalline type that will not cling to surface areas. These crystals are tiny and circulation normally through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not need continuous regrowth.</p>
