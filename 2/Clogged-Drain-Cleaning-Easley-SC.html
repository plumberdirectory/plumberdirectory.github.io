    <meta name="description" content="Professional Plumbing Contractor Easley South Carolina - One tip for filling your gas tank is to avoid filling up if a fuel tanker is filling the underground tanks at the gas station you pull up to. The gas tanker is filling the underground tanks that supply the pumps with fuel, and as the underground tanks get filled the sediment at the bottom of the giant tank is getting stirred around and mixed with the new fuel being added, making it more likely that the fuel coming from the pumps contains some of the sediment that will then be transferred to your gas tank.">
