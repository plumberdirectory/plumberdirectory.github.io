<p>Changing your sink is a detailed procedure. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are using copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it might require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>
