<p>A. If you have rust spots, using phosphoric acid usually will help eliminate them. If you would like to try the gentlest approach perhaps attempt using some Coke on the rust first.  No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola includes a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to listed below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Clean with a soft fabric and then more Coke, over and over, etc. If that doesn't do the trick then use Naval Jelly which includes a lot more phosphoric acid (make sure to check out the instructions and security warnings first!). Naval Jelly is what we here at ® use to get rid of rust spots and it's readily offered at a lot of hardware stores.</p>
<p>The majority of softeners have a bypass constructed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to supply some kind of maintenance to it or perhaps while you're working on installing it. If the softener you select does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to develop one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to keep the unit.</p>
