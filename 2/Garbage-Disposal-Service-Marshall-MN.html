Obstructions in a component can trigger destructive damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>

<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
