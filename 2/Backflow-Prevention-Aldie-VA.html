<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
