<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regrowth usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
